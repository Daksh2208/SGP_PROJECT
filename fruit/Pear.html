            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Ideal for planting and establishing new trees. Ensure adequate watering and protection from frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Continue watering and provide support as needed. Watch for pests and diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Harvest pears when they are firm but mature. Prepare trees for winter by mulching and pruning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Prefers well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Optimal pH is between 6.0 and 7.0.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure to enhance soil fertility and drainage.</li>
