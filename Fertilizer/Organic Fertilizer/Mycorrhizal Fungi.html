        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Mycorrhizal fungi are a type of beneficial fungi that form symbiotic relationships with plant roots. These fungi enhance nutrient and water uptake for plants, improve soil health, and increase plant resistance to diseases and environmental stresses. Mycorrhizal fungi are crucial in organic farming and gardening, providing a natural method to boost plant growth and soil fertility.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Mycorrhizal fungi are typically applied as a powder, granules, or in a liquid form. They should be mixed with water or soil before application.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply mycorrhizal fungi at planting time or during soil preparation to establish a beneficial relationship with plant roots early on.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mix according to the product instructions, typically 1-2 tablespoons per plant or per planting hole.</li>
                        <li>For larger areas, use the recommended rate per square meter or acre.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soil Incorporation: Mix the fungi with the soil before planting or apply directly to the soil surface.</li>
                        <li>Planting Hole: Place the fungi in the planting hole and mix with soil before planting.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water the soil thoroughly after application to activate the fungi and help them establish contact with plant roots.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Observe plant growth and soil health, and adjust application rates if necessary based on plant response.</li>
            </ul>
