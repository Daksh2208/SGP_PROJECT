        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Rock phosphate is a naturally occurring mineral used as a source of phosphorus for plants. It is an essential component in agricultural fertilizers, helping to promote healthy root development, flowering, and fruiting. Rock phosphate is derived from phosphate-rich rock deposits and is a valuable resource in sustainable farming due to its slow-release properties and low environmental impact.</p>

        <section class="crop-info">
            <h2>Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers</h2>
            <p>Rock phosphate benefits a wide range of plants by providing a steady supply of phosphorus. Key applications include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crops:</strong> Corn, Soybeans, Wheat</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Tomatoes, Peppers, Carrots</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Apples, Citrus fruits, Grapes</li>
                <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Lilies, Roses, Marigolds</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Rock phosphate is most effective in acidic to neutral soils with a pH range of 5.5 to 7.0. It is less effective in alkaline soils. It should be applied to well-drained soils to ensure proper phosphorus availability and uptake by plants. Incorporating rock phosphate into the soil helps improve soil fertility and promotes better plant growth.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Rock Phosphate</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil Application:</strong> Incorporate rock phosphate into the soil before planting. A typical application rate is 500-1000 kg per hectare, depending on soil test results and plant requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Broadcasting:</strong> Spread rock phosphate evenly over the soil surface and then incorporate it into the top 10-15 cm of soil using a tiller or rake.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertility Management:</strong> Use rock phosphate as part of a balanced fertilization program, combining it with other nutrients based on soil test recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong> Adjust the application rate based on soil phosphorus levels, crop needs, and soil test results.</li>
            </ul>
