        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Horse manure is a popular organic fertilizer that improves soil structure, enhances microbial activity, and supplies essential nutrients to plants. Due to its relatively high nitrogen content, it is a great addition to gardens and agricultural fields, helping boost plant growth and improve long-term soil fertility.</p>

        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Horse manure works best in soils with good drainage and moderate fertility. It improves the soil's texture, increases water retention, and boosts organic matter content. It’s especially effective in sandy or clay-heavy soils.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Horse Manure Fertilizer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Composting:</strong> Horse manure should be composted before use to kill any weed seeds or pathogens. Composting for 3-6 months results in a well-balanced, nutrient-rich material.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply in early spring or fall to prepare the soil for planting. Avoid using fresh manure directly on crops as it may burn the plants due to high nitrogen levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For garden beds: Apply 2-3 inches of composted horse manure and mix it into the top 6-8 inches of soil.</li>
                        <li>For potted plants: Use a 50/50 mix of composted manure and potting soil.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Apply around the tree’s drip line and mix into the soil.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Water the soil thoroughly after applying manure to help nutrients leach into the root zone.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monitor plant response and adjust application based on plant needs and soil health.</li>
