        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Vermicompost is an organic fertilizer produced through the decomposition of organic matter by earthworms. This process results in a nutrient-rich compost that enhances soil health and plant growth. Vermicompost is highly regarded for its ability to improve soil structure, increase nutrient availability, and support sustainable agriculture practices.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Mix 1-2 inches of vermicompost into the soil per square foot before planting.</li>
                        <li>As a top-dressing, apply 0.5-1 inch of vermicompost around the base of plants every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soil Incorporation: Mix vermicompost into the top 6-8 inches of soil before planting.</li>
                        <li>Top-Dressing: Spread vermicompost around the base of established plants and lightly work it into the soil surface.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water plants after applying vermicompost to help integrate it into the soil and activate its benefits.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Observe plant growth and adjust the frequency and amount of vermicompost applied based on plant response.</li>
            </ul>
