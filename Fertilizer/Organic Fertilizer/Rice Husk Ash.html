        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Rice husk ash (RHA) is an organic byproduct from the burning of rice husks, which are the outer shell of the rice grain. It is a valuable resource in agriculture due to its rich content of silica and other essential minerals. RHA is used as a soil amendment and fertilizer, contributing to improved soil fertility and plant growth while recycling agricultural waste.</p>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Rice husk ash is most effective in improving soil texture and fertility in well-drained soils. It helps to reduce soil acidity and increase the availability of essential nutrients. The ideal pH for using RHA is between 6.0 and 7.5. It is particularly useful for sandy or loamy soils but can also benefit clay soils by improving aeration and drainage.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Rice Husk Ash</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil Amendment:</strong> Mix RHA into the soil before planting to improve soil structure and nutrient content. Typically, 5-10 tons per hectare are applied, depending on soil conditions and crop requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Spread a thin layer of RHA on the soil surface around existing plants to provide a slow-release source of nutrients and improve soil pH.</li>
                <li><strong>Compost Additive:</strong> Incorporate RHA into compost piles to enhance compost quality and nutrient content. It helps balance the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and improves aeration.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong> Use approximately 1-2 kilograms per square meter for garden beds, adjusting based on soil tests and specific plant needs.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Nutrient Composition -->
        <section class="nutrient-content">
            <h2>Nutrient Composition</h2>
            <p>Rice husk ash is primarily composed of silica (about 85-90%), with smaller amounts of potassium, calcium, magnesium, and trace elements. Key nutrients include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Silica (SiOâ‚‚):</strong> Strengthens plant cell walls and improves disease resistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Potassium (K):</strong> Enhances plant growth, fruit quality, and stress tolerance.</li>
                <li><strong>Calcium (Ca):</strong> Improves soil structure and promotes healthy root development.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnesium (Mg):</strong> Essential for photosynthesis and overall plant health.</li>
            </ul>
