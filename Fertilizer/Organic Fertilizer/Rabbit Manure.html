        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Rabbit manure is a highly effective and nutrient-dense organic fertilizer that gardeners and farmers can use to enrich the soil and promote healthy plant growth. Unlike many other manures, rabbit manure is "cold," meaning it can be applied directly to the garden without the need for composting. It’s an excellent source of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and trace minerals, offering long-lasting benefits for a variety of plants.</p>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Rabbit manure can be used to improve a wide range of soil types, from sandy soils to heavy clays. It enhances soil structure by adding organic matter, improving drainage in heavy soils and boosting water retention in sandy soils. Rabbit manure is also ideal for promoting the growth of beneficial soil organisms.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Rabbit Manure</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Direct Application:</strong> Since rabbit manure is cold, it can be applied directly to the garden without burning plants. Simply spread it evenly around plants or mix it into the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Composting:</strong> Rabbit manure can also be composted with other organic materials to create a rich compost that further improves soil health.</li>
                <li><strong>Liquid Fertilizer:</strong> Soak rabbit manure in water to create a nutrient-rich "manure tea" that can be used as a liquid fertilizer.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Rate:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>For garden beds: Apply 1-2 pounds of rabbit manure per 100 square feet.</li>
                        <li>For container gardening: Mix 1 tablespoon of rabbit manure per gallon of soil.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Use rabbit manure as a top dressing around established plants to give them a steady supply of nutrients throughout the growing season.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Nutrient Composition -->
        <section class="nutrient-content">
            <h2>Nutrient Composition</h2>
            <p>Rabbit manure is rich in nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), with a typical NPK ratio of around 2.4-1.4-0.6. It also contains a variety of micronutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and zinc, which help support plant growth and soil fertility.</p>
