        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Vinegar solution is particularly useful in certain soil conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil Type:</strong> Effective in well-drained soils. Be cautious with heavy clay soils as excessive use can lead to soil acidification.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil pH:</strong> Vinegar can lower soil pH, making it suitable for soils that need acidification.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Matter:</strong> Works well in soils with organic matter; however, overuse can disrupt soil microbial balance.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Vinegar Solution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Dilute white vinegar with water to create a solution. Typical ratios are 1 part vinegar to 2 parts water for general use, but adjustments may be needed based on application.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply vinegar solution during dry weather to avoid rain washing it away. Use when plants are not stressed.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For weed control, apply the solution directly to the weeds, avoiding contact with desirable plants.</li>
                        <li>For soil acidification, use 1-2 cups of diluted vinegar solution per square foot of soil. Monitor soil pH and adjust as needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spray Application: Apply the vinegar solution using a spray bottle or garden sprayer, targeting weeds or affected areas.</li>
                        <li>Soil Drench: Pour the diluted solution around the base of plants or over the soil to adjust pH.</li>
