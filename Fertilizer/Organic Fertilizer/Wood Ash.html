        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Wood Ash as Fertilizer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Ensure wood ash is free of contaminants such as plastic or metal. Sift the ash to remove large particles.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply wood ash in the fall or early spring before planting. It can also be applied during the growing season as a top-dressing.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For soil amendment: Spread 5-10 pounds of wood ash per 100 square feet of soil, depending on soil acidity and nutrient needs.</li>
                        <li>For top-dressing: Use 1-2 tablespoons of wood ash per plant, applied around the base of the plant.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soil Incorporation: Mix wood ash into the soil using a rake or tiller to ensure even distribution and prevent nutrient loss.</li>
                        <li>Top-Dressing: Sprinkle wood ash around plants and lightly incorporate it into the soil surface.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water the soil after applying wood ash to help dissolve the nutrients and promote their absorption by plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Monitor soil pH and plant response to adjust the amount and frequency of wood ash applications as needed.</li>
            </ul>
