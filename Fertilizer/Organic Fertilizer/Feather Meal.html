        <h1>Feather Meal Fertilizer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Feather meal fertilizer is a byproduct of the poultry industry, made from processed poultry feathers. Rich in nitrogen, it is a slow-release organic fertilizer that is ideal for promoting healthy plant growth, particularly during the vegetative stage. Feather meal provides a sustainable and natural alternative to synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, with long-lasting benefits for both plants and soil health.</p>

        <!-- Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers -->
        <section class="crop-info">
            <h2>Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers</h2>
            <p>Feather meal is particularly beneficial for nitrogen-hungry crops and plants. It is commonly used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crops:</strong> Corn, Wheat, Barley, Rice</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Leafy Greens (Spinach, Lettuce, Kale), Broccoli, Cauliflower</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Apples, Citrus Fruits, Berries</li>
                <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Sunflowers, Lilies, Dahlias</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Feather meal is compatible with a variety of soil types, but it is particularly effective in nitrogen-deficient soils. It works well in soils with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Feather meal can also be used in composting to accelerate the decomposition process by adding nitrogen to the mix.</p>
