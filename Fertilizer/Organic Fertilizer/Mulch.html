        <h1>Mulch Organic Fertilizer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Mulch is an organic material applied to the soil surface to enhance moisture retention, reduce weed growth, and improve soil health. Organic mulch, derived from plant materials like straw, leaves, and grass clippings, also decomposes to provide valuable nutrients, making it an essential tool in sustainable gardening and farming practices.</p>

        <section class="crop-info">
            <h2>Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers</h2>
            <p>Mulch is beneficial for a wide range of plants, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crops:</strong> Corn, Potatoes, Soybeans</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Tomatoes, Peppers, Carrots</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Apples, Grapes, Berries</li>
                <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Marigolds, Petunias, Sunflowers</li>

        </section>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Mulch is effective in most soil types. It helps in conserving moisture, maintaining soil temperature, and preventing erosion. Well-drained and nutrient-rich soils benefit the most from organic mulch. The mulch gradually decomposes, enriching the soil and enhancing its structure over time.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Mulch as Fertilizer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Organic mulch such as straw, bark, or leaves should be clean and free from chemicals or weed seeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply mulch during early spring or after planting, ensuring coverage throughout the growing season.</li>
                <li><strong>Thickness:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apply a 2-4 inch layer of mulch around the base of plants.</li>
                        <li>Ensure not to cover stems or trunks directly to avoid rot.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Types of Mulch:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grass Clippings: Nitrogen-rich, great for vegetables and crops.</li>
                        <li>Wood Chips: Ideal for perennial plants and trees.</li>
                        <li>Leaves: Good for maintaining moisture and reducing weeds.</li>
