        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Kelp meal is an organic fertilizer derived from dried and ground seaweed, specifically brown algae like Ascophyllum nodosum. Rich in micronutrients, growth hormones, and trace minerals, kelp meal is highly valued for promoting plant health, improving soil structure, and enhancing the nutrient uptake of plants. It is slow-releasing and eco-friendly, making it ideal for sustainable farming practices.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>For garden beds: Apply 1-2 pounds of kelp meal per 100 square feet of soil.</li>
                        <li>For potted plants: Mix 1-2 tablespoons of kelp meal into the potting soil.</li>
                        <li>For lawns: Apply 5 pounds per 1,000 square feet as a broadcast application.</li>
