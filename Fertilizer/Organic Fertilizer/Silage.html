        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Silage is a type of fodder made from fermented, high-moisture fodder crops which are preserved in a silo or other storage system. Commonly made from maize (corn), grass, legumes, and other forages, silage provides a valuable feed resource for livestock, particularly during periods of low forage availability. The fermentation process helps to preserve the nutritional value of the feed and makes it digestible for animals.</p>

            <h2>Preparation and Storage Methods</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Silage is typically harvested when the crop reaches the appropriate maturity stage, which varies depending on the crop used.</li>
                <li><strong>Chopping:</strong> The harvested crop is chopped into smaller pieces to facilitate fermentation and storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> The chopped crop is packed into a silo, bunker, or pit, and sealed to create an anaerobic environment that promotes fermentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Proper sealing and covering are essential to prevent air from entering the storage and to ensure successful fermentation.</li>
            </ul>
