        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Alfameal Fertilizer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply Alfameal during the early stages of crop growth, ideally just before or at the time of planting. For perennial crops, apply in the early spring before new growth begins.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>For medium-sized crops: Use 50-60 kg per hectare.</li>
                        <li>For larger crops or high-yielding varieties: Increase dosage to 70-80 kg per hectare.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables and fruits: Use 40-50 kg per hectare, adjusting based on specific crop needs and soil fertility.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use tilling or mixing equipment to incorporate Alfameal into the top 10-15 cm of soil for even distribution.</li>
                        <li>For broadcast application, ensure thorough mixing with the soil to prevent nutrient stratification.</li>
                        <li>For precision farming, use a fertilizer spreader to apply Alfameal in targeted areas based on soil nutrient tests.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Water the field immediately after application to activate the nutrients. Ensure the soil is moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                        <li>For optimal nutrient uptake, maintain consistent soil moisture levels throughout the growing season.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Regularly monitor crop growth and soil conditions. Adjust the dosage and application frequency based on plant response and soil nutrient levels.</li>
                        <li>Conduct soil tests periodically to assess nutrient availability and make necessary adjustments.</li>
                    </ul>

        </section>

        <!-- Additional Research Topics -->
        <section class="impact-microbial-activity">
            <h2>Impact of Alfameal on Soil Microbial Activity</h2>
            <p>Alfameal fertilizer significantly boosts soil microbial activity due to its rich organic content. The composted plant materials within Alfameal serve as an energy source for beneficial microbes, promoting their proliferation. These microbes play a crucial role in breaking down organic matter into essential nutrients that plants can easily absorb. Over time, increased microbial activity improves soil structure, enhances nutrient availability, and suppresses certain soil-borne diseases. While short-term benefits are clear, further research is underway to assess long-term effects on microbial diversity and how Alfameal contributes to overall soil health.</p>

        <section class="effectiveness-climatic-regions">
            <h2>Effectiveness in Different Climatic Regions</h2>
            <p>Alfameal performs optimally in temperate and subtropical climates where rainfall is moderate and soil conditions are generally favorable. In dry regions, its water-holding capacity can be advantageous, though adjustments may be necessary to prevent over-application. In regions with high rainfall, monitoring for nutrient leaching is essential. The fertilizer's effectiveness can be influenced by local soil types, so localized recommendations are often needed. Ongoing research aims to tailor Alfameal’s application for specific climatic conditions and soil types to maximize its benefits.</p>
