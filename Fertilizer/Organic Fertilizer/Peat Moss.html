        <h1>Peat Moss: A Comprehensive Organic Fertilizer Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Peat moss is a natural, organic soil amendment harvested from decomposed plant material in peat bogs. It is highly valued for its ability to retain moisture, improve soil structure, and promote healthy root development in a wide range of plants. Peat moss is commonly used in gardening, landscaping, and agriculture to improve the growing conditions of both outdoor and indoor plants.</p>

        <!-- Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers -->
        <section class="crop-info">
            <h2>Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers</h2>
            <p>Peat moss is particularly beneficial for plants that require well-draining, moisture-retentive soil, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crops:</strong> Potatoes, Strawberries, Carrots</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Lettuce, Onions, Peppers</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Blueberries, Cranberries, Raspberries</li>
                <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Azaleas, Orchids, Rhododendrons</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Peat moss is best suited for soils that need improved water retention, such as sandy soils. It also helps lighten heavy clay soils, promoting better aeration and drainage. Peat moss is slightly acidic, making it ideal for acid-loving plants and improving the overall structure of garden beds and potting mixes.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Peat Moss</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Peat moss typically comes in bales or bags. Moisten the peat moss thoroughly before application to prevent it from repelling water once added to the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply peat moss in the spring or fall when preparing garden beds or potting plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For garden beds: Use 2-3 inches of peat moss over the surface and mix it into the top 6-8 inches of soil.</li>
                        <li>For containers: Mix peat moss into the potting soil at a ratio of 1 part peat moss to 2 parts soil.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soil Amendment: Mix peat moss evenly into the soil to enhance moisture retention and improve soil texture.</li>
                        <li>Top Dressing: Spread a thin layer of peat moss on the soil surface around plants to conserve moisture and regulate temperature.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water the soil after applying peat moss to help integrate it into the soil and ensure proper moisture levels for plants.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Nutrient Composition -->
        <section class="nutrient-content">
            <h2>Nutrient Composition</h2>
            <p>Peat moss is not a significant source of nutrients, but it does contribute to improved soil structure and moisture retention. It provides trace amounts of organic material, helping to build healthy soil ecosystems over time. When combined with other fertilizers, peat moss enhances the effectiveness of nutrient uptake.</p>

        <!-- Benefits -->
        <section class="benefits">
            <h2>Benefits of Peat Moss</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Improves soil moisture retention, making it ideal for dry areas.</li>
                <li>Enhances soil aeration and promotes root growth.</li>
                <li>Helps balance the pH in acidic soils, especially for acid-loving plants.</li>
                <li>Prevents soil compaction, allowing better root penetration and drainage.</li>
                <li>Serves as a long-term amendment for building organic matter in the soil.</li>
            </ul>
