        <h1>Dried Blood Fertilizer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Dried blood, also known as blood meal, is an organic fertilizer made from the blood of animals, usually from slaughterhouses. It is rich in nitrogen and is often used to quickly increase nitrogen levels in the soil. This fertilizer is ideal for promoting leafy growth in plants and is commonly used in vegetable gardens and for lawns.</p>

        <!-- Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers -->
        <section class="crop-info">
            <h2>Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers</h2>
            <p>Dried blood fertilizer is particularly effective for plants that require a high nitrogen intake. It is commonly used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crops:</strong> Corn, Wheat, Spinach, Lettuce</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Leafy greens like Kale, Cabbage, Lettuce, Broccoli</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Grapes, Raspberries, Blackberries</li>
                <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Lilies, Roses, Hydrangeas</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Dried blood fertilizer is suitable for all soil types, but it works best in well-draining, loamy soil. It should be used in soils with a pH level of 6.0 to 7.5 for optimal nutrient absorption. Overuse in sandy soils can lead to nitrogen leaching.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Dried Blood Fertilizer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply dried blood fertilizer in early spring before planting and mid-season for heavy-feeding plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For vegetables: Use 1-2 tablespoons per square foot of soil.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Apply 1-2 cups per tree, spread evenly around the base.</li>
                        <li>For flowers: Use 1 tablespoon per square foot, especially for nitrogen-hungry flowers like roses.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mix dried blood into the soil or garden beds before planting.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle lightly around plants and water thoroughly to activate the fertilizer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water the soil immediately after applying to help the nitrogen seep into the ground.</li>
            </ul>
