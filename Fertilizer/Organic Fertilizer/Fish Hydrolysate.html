        <h1>Fish Hydrolysate Organic Fertilizer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Fish hydrolysate is an organic fertilizer derived from the enzymatic digestion of fish. Unlike fish emulsion, which is processed with heat, fish hydrolysate is cold-processed, preserving a higher concentration of beneficial nutrients and enzymes. This fertilizer is renowned for its ability to improve soil health, stimulate microbial activity, and enhance plant growth.</p>
