            <h2>How to Use Goat Manure Fertilizer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Goat manure can be used fresh or composted. Composting it for a few months reduces the risk of pathogens and enhances its nutrient value.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply goat manure in the fall or early spring before planting to allow time for decomposition and nutrient release.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For garden beds: Incorporate 2-4 inches of composted goat manure into the soil per 100 square feet.</li>
                        <li>For potted plants: Mix 1 part goat manure with 3 parts potting soil.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spread evenly over the soil and incorporate with a garden fork or tiller.</li>
                        <li>For a slow-release effect, mix with the topsoil before planting.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Water the area thoroughly after application to help integrate the manure into the soil and activate nutrient release.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monitor plant growth and soil condition, adjusting the application rate as needed based on plant response.</li>
                    </ul>
