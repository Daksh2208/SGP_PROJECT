        <h1>Eggshell Fertilizer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Eggshell fertilizer is an organic, natural source of calcium that can be used to enrich your garden's soil. Derived from the shells of chicken eggs, it is a popular option for gardeners looking to provide slow-release calcium and trace nutrients to their plants. Eggshell fertilizer is ideal for maintaining strong plant cell structure and preventing common calcium deficiencies like blossom end rot in tomatoes and peppers.</p>

        <!-- Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers -->
        <section class="crop-info">
            <h2>Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers</h2>
            <p>Eggshell fertilizer is particularly effective for plants that need calcium-rich soil. It is commonly used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crops:</strong> Tomatoes, Peppers, Eggplant</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Squash, Cucumbers, Broccoli</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Strawberries, Apples, Grapes</li>
                <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Roses, Marigolds, Zinnias</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Eggshell fertilizer is suitable for most soil types, especially those with a low calcium content. It works best in slightly acidic to neutral soils with a pH level between 6.0 and 7.5. Overuse in alkaline soils (high pH) may make it difficult for plants to absorb other nutrients.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Eggshell Fertilizer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Crush eggshells into a fine powder before applying for better absorption.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply eggshells at the start of the growing season or mix into compost before planting.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For vegetables: Use 1 tablespoon of crushed eggshell powder per plant or square foot of soil.</li>
                        <li>For fruits: Apply 2 tablespoons around the base of the plant or tree.</li>
                        <li>For flowers: Use 1-2 tablespoons per square foot, especially for calcium-loving plants like roses.</li>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mix the crushed eggshells directly into the soil during planting.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle eggshell powder around plants and water it in.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Nutrient Composition -->
        <section class="nutrient-content">
            <h2>Nutrient Composition</h2>
            <p>Eggshell fertilizer is primarily composed of calcium carbonate, which makes it an excellent source of calcium. The nutrient breakdown typically includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Calcium (Ca):</strong> 93-95%</li>
                <li><strong>Magnesium (Mg):</strong> Trace amounts</li>
                <li><strong>Potassium (K):</strong> Trace amounts</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus (P):</strong> Trace amounts</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Eggshells break down slowly, making them less effective for immediate calcium needs.</li>
                <li>Overuse can increase soil alkalinity, which may negatively affect plant growth.</li>
                <li>Crushed eggshells can attract pests like rodents or birds if not buried in the soil properly.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Environmental Impact -->
        <section class="environmental-impact">
            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <p>Eggshell fertilizer is an environmentally friendly choice, as it utilizes kitchen waste that would otherwise be discarded. It is a natural, renewable source of calcium and helps reduce the need for synthetic calcium fertilizers. However, eggshells take time to break down in the soil, so they may not be a fast solution for calcium deficiencies.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Additional Research Topics -->
        <section class="impact-soil-health">
            <h2>Impact on Soil Health</h2>
            <p>Eggshells improve soil structure by adding organic matter when composted. They enhance microbial activity and help create a healthy, balanced ecosystem in the soil. The slow release of calcium helps plants develop strong roots and overall better health.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="effectiveness-plant-growth">
            <h2>Effectiveness for Plant Growth</h2>
            <p>Eggshell fertilizer is especially effective for calcium-loving plants, such as tomatoes, peppers, and squash. It helps prevent calcium deficiencies, leading to healthier, more robust plants. However, it may take several months for the eggshells to fully break down and release their nutrients.</p>
