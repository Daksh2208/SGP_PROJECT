        <h1>Blood Meal Fertilizer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Blood meal is a high-nitrogen organic fertilizer made from dried animal blood, commonly sourced from cattle. It is used to enrich soil with nitrogen, promoting rapid plant growth and healthy foliage. It is particularly beneficial for nitrogen-hungry plants.</p>

        <!-- Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers -->
        <section class="crop-info">
            <h2>Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers</h2>
            <p>Blood meal fertilizer is especially beneficial for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crops:</strong> Corn, Wheat, Barley, Sugarcane</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Apples, Grapes, Melons, Citrus</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Spinach, Broccoli, Cabbage, Tomatoes</li>
                <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Lilies, Roses, Geraniums, Daisies</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Blood meal is ideal for soils that are low in nitrogen. It can be used in a variety of soil types, but it works best in soils with neutral to slightly acidic pH levels. Excessive use in already nitrogen-rich soils may lead to burning of plants.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Blood Meal Fertilizer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Blood meal is best applied early in the growing season or when planting nitrogen-loving crops.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>For garden beds: Use 1-2 cups per 100 square feet.</li>
                        <li>For individual plants: Apply 1 tablespoon per plant.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Use 1 cup per inch of trunk diameter.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mix blood meal into the soil at the root zone before planting.</li>
                        <li>Apply as a side dressing during the growing season to boost nitrogen levels.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Water thoroughly after applying blood meal to help it break down and release nutrients into the soil.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Observe plant growth and foliage color to ensure adequate nitrogen levels. Adjust the application if needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Avoid over-application to prevent nitrogen burn and root damage.</li>
                        <li>Use in moderation in nitrogen-rich soils to avoid excessive foliage growth at the expense of fruiting and flowering.</li>
                    </ul>
