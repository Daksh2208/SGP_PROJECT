            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Biochar can be applied throughout the year, with the best results seen when applied before planting or during the growing season.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>For general crops: Apply 5-10 tons per hectare.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Apply 1-2 kg around the base of each tree.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: Use 0.5-1 kg per square meter mixed into the topsoil.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Incorporate biochar into the soil by mixing it into the top 10-15 cm of soil.</li>
                        <li>Combine it with compost or other organic fertilizers to enhance nutrient retention.</li>
                        <li>Broadcast application followed by tilling or mixing into the soil is effective.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Biochar should be watered after application to help it integrate into the soil and activate its benefits.</li>
                        <li>Moist soil enhances biochar's ability to retain nutrients and water.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Regularly monitor soil conditions and plant growth, adjusting the amount of biochar used depending on the soil type and plant needs.</li>
                        <li>Reapply every 1-2 years to maintain soil fertility and health.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Avoid overapplying biochar, as it can alter soil pH and affect microbial activity.</li>
                        <li>Use in combination with other fertilizers to avoid nutrient deficiencies.</li>
                    </ul>
