        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Poultry pellets are a rich organic fertilizer made from dried and processed poultry manure. This natural fertilizer is nutrient-dense, containing high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, making it an excellent choice for boosting plant growth. Poultry pellets are commonly used in both home gardening and commercial agriculture for improving soil fertility and providing long-lasting nutrients.</p>

        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Poultry Pellets</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Poultry pellets are easy to apply and require no special preparation. However, they should be applied evenly across the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> The best time to apply poultry pellets is during the early growing season or just before planting. They can also be used as a top dressing throughout the growing season.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For garden beds: Apply 2-3 lbs of poultry pellets per 100 square feet.</li>
                        <li>For containers: Add 1-2 tablespoons of poultry pellets per gallon of potting soil.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soil Amendment: Mix poultry pellets into the top 6-8 inches of soil to improve fertility before planting.</li>
                        <li>Top Dressing: Spread the pellets around established plants to give them a nutrient boost throughout the growing season.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after applying poultry pellets to help the nutrients dissolve and become available to plants.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Nutrient Composition -->
        <section class="nutrient-content">
            <h2>Nutrient Composition</h2>
            <p>Poultry pellets contain a balanced mix of key nutrients, primarily nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK). The typical NPK ratio for poultry pellets is 4-3-2. They also provide essential micronutrients like calcium, magnesium, and sulfur, which are vital for healthy plant development.</p>
