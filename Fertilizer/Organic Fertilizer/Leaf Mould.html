        <h1>Leaf Mould Organic Fertilizer: A Complete Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Leaf mould is an organic fertilizer made from decomposed leaves, offering a natural, nutrient-rich amendment for soil. It is commonly used to improve soil structure, retain moisture, and increase microbial activity. Unlike compost, which breaks down through bacterial action, leaf mould decomposes primarily through fungal activity, resulting in a dark, crumbly material that is excellent for gardening.</p>

        <!-- Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers -->
        <section class="crop-info">
            <h2>Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers</h2>
            <p>Leaf mould is highly versatile and beneficial for various plants, providing essential organic matter and moisture retention. It is particularly useful for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crops:</strong> Potatoes, Corn, Wheat</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Lettuce, Spinach, Beans</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Berries, Apples, Citrus trees</li>
                <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Roses, Daisies, Tulips</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Leaf mould works best in soils that benefit from improved water retention and enhanced aeration. Ideal for loamy and sandy soils, it helps maintain moisture levels and enriches poor soils by adding organic matter. Leaf mould can also help in soils with slightly acidic to neutral pH (5.5 to 7.0).</p>

        <section class="nutrient-content">
            <h2>Nutrient Composition</h2>
            <p>Leaf mould is not a high-nutrient fertilizer like manure or compost, but its benefits primarily lie in its ability to improve soil structure and water retention. However, it does provide some nutrients, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Matter:</strong> Enriches soil with organic material.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Small amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.</li>
                <li><strong>Fungi:</strong> Introduces beneficial fungi to aid plant growth and nutrient uptake.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
