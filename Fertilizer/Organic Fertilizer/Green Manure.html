        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Green manure refers to plants grown specifically to be incorporated into the soil to improve its fertility. These plants, often legumes or cover crops, are grown to enhance soil structure, increase organic matter, and boost nutrient levels. Green manure is a sustainable and eco-friendly method to enrich the soil naturally and prepare it for future crops.</p>

            <h2>Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers</h2>
            <p>Green manure is versatile and benefits a wide range of plants. It is particularly effective for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crops:</strong> Corn, Wheat, Beans</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Carrots, Lettuce, Tomatoes</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Apples, Strawberries, Melons</li>
                <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Marigolds, Sunflowers, Lilies</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Green manure can be grown in various soil types but thrives in well-drained, fertile soils. It is especially beneficial for soils that are depleted of nutrients or have poor structure. Ideal soil pH ranges from 6.0 to 7.5.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Green Manure Fertilizer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Choose appropriate green manure plants such as legumes (clover, vetch) or grasses (rye, barley) based on your soil and crop needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow green manure seeds during the off-season or between main crops to allow time for growth and decomposition.</li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once the green manure plants have reached maturity (usually before flowering), cut them down and incorporate them into the soil using a plow or tiller.</li>
                        <li>Allow the green manure to decompose in the soil for several weeks before planting the main crops.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil moist during the growing phase to ensure healthy plant growth. Watering after incorporation helps in the decomposition process.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Observe the soil and plant response after incorporation. Adjust the types of green manure or the timing as needed based on soil health and crop requirements.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Nutrient Composition -->
        <section class="nutrient-content">
            <h2>Nutrient Composition</h2>
