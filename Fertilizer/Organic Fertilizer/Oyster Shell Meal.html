                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For garden beds: Use 2-4 cups of oyster shell meal per 100 square feet of garden area.</li>
                        <li>For container plants: Add 2 tablespoons of oyster shell meal to the potting soil for each plant.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incorporation Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Top Dressing: Spread the oyster shell meal evenly over the soil and water it in.</li>
                        <li>Soil Amendment: Work oyster shell meal into the top 2-4 inches of soil to improve structure and provide long-term calcium release.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water the soil thoroughly after application to help the oyster shell meal dissolve and integrate with the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Monitor soil pH regularly and reapply oyster shell meal as needed to maintain the desired pH range.</li>
            </ul>
