        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Nitrophosphate Fertilizer is an inorganic fertilizer known for its high phosphorus content and balanced nutrient profile. It is produced by treating phosphate rock with nitric acid, which increases its solubility and availability to plants. Nitrophosphate Fertilizer is widely used to enhance soil fertility and promote healthy plant growth.</p>
