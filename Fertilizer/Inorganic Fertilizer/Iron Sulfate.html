        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Iron sulfate is an inorganic compound commonly used as a fertilizer and soil amendment to address iron deficiencies in plants. It provides a readily available source of iron, which is essential for chlorophyll production and overall plant health. Iron sulfate helps in correcting iron deficiency chlorosis and improving plant growth and yield.</p>

        <!-- Nutrient Composition -->
        <section class="nutrient-composition">
            <h2>Nutrient Composition</h2>
            <p>Iron sulfate primarily provides:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Iron (Fe):</strong> 20-30%, essential for chlorophyll synthesis and preventing iron deficiency chlorosis.</li>
                <li><strong>Sulfur (S):</strong> 12-15%, supports protein synthesis and enzyme functions in plants.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Iron sulfate is typically applied to the soil or as a foliar spray. For optimal effectiveness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil pH:</strong> Works best in slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 5.5-7.0). If soil is too alkaline, iron availability decreases.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Type:</strong> Suitable for various soil types, including loamy and sandy soils. Avoid heavy clay soils where iron may become less available.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Iron Sulfate</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply during the growing season, ideally before or during periods of high plant demand for iron.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For soil application: Typically 200-400 kg per hectare, depending on soil tests and plant needs.</li>
                        <li>For foliar application: Generally 1-2 kg per hectare, diluted in water as per manufacturer’s instructions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For soil application: Incorporate into the soil before planting or as a side-dress during the growing season.</li>
                        <li>For foliar application: Dissolve in water and spray evenly on plant leaves, covering both sides for optimal absorption.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water plants and soil adequately before application to enhance nutrient absorption and reduce the risk of leaf burn.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Regularly check for signs of iron deficiency and adjust the dosage based on plant response and soil tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Wear protective equipment to avoid inhaling dust or getting it on skin. Store in a cool, dry place away from children and pets.</li>
            </ul>
