        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sulfur-Coated Urea (SCU) is a controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer that combines urea with a sulfur coating. This coating slows down the release of nitrogen into the soil, providing a steady supply of nutrients to plants over an extended period. SCU is designed to improve nitrogen use efficiency, reduce the frequency of application, and minimize nitrogen loss through leaching and volatilization.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply Sulfur-Coated Urea before planting or during the growing season, depending on the crop’s nutrient requirements and growth stage.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For crops: Generally 100-200 kg per hectare, adjusted based on soil fertility and crop needs.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Typically 50-150 kg per hectare, considering tree size and nutrient needs.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: Usually 75-150 kg per hectare, tailored to specific plant requirements and growth conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broadcast evenly over the soil surface and incorporate into the soil through tillage or cultivation.</li>
                        <li>For fertigation: Dissolve in water and apply through irrigation systems for targeted nutrient delivery.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water the soil thoroughly after application to activate the sulfur coating and facilitate nutrient release.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Regularly monitor plant growth and soil conditions. Adjust application rates based on plant response and soil tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Handle with care to avoid direct contact with skin and eyes. Follow safety guidelines for storage and application.</li>
            </ul>
