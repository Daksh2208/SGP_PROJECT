        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Urea Ammonium Nitrate Solution (UAN) is a liquid fertilizer containing a mix of urea and ammonium nitrate, providing a balanced source of nitrogen. UAN solutions are widely used in agriculture to supply essential nitrogen for plant growth. They are available in different concentrations, typically ranging from 28% to 32% nitrogen content, and are known for their versatility and efficiency in improving crop yields.</p>

                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply UAN during the growing season, ideally during periods of active plant growth to maximize nitrogen uptake.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For crops: Typically 100-250 kg per hectare, adjusted based on crop type, growth stage, and soil nitrogen levels.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Usually 50-150 kg per hectare, considering tree size and nutrient needs.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: Generally 75-200 kg per hectare, tailored to specific plant needs and growth conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apply using a sprayer or injector system for even distribution.</li>
                        <li>Can be applied as a side-dress or incorporated into the soil to minimize volatilization and maximize nitrogen use efficiency.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Ensure soil is moist before application to facilitate nutrient uptake and reduce the risk of volatilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Monitor plant response and adjust application rates as needed based on growth and nitrogen levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Handle with care to avoid skin contact and inhalation. Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and incompatible substances.</li>
            </ul>
