        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Triple Superphosphate (TSP) is a highly concentrated phosphate fertilizer known for its high phosphorus content. Produced by treating phosphate rock with phosphoric acid, TSP contains approximately 45-50% phosphorus pentoxide (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), making it one of the most effective sources of phosphorus for plants. It is widely used to promote root development, flowering, and fruiting in various crops and plants.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Triple Superphosphate (TSP)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply TSP before planting or during the early growth stages to ensure phosphorus availability for root development and plant establishment.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For crops: Typically 50-150 kg per hectare, adjusted based on soil test results and crop requirements.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Usually 30-80 kg per hectare, depending on tree size and nutrient needs.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: Generally 40-100 kg per hectare, tailored to specific plant needs and soil conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broadcast evenly over the soil surface and incorporate into the soil through tillage or cultivation.</li>
                        <li>Apply in planting rows or holes for more targeted nutrient placement.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water the soil thoroughly after application to dissolve the phosphate and aid in nutrient uptake by plant roots.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Monitor plant growth and soil phosphorus levels. Adjust application rates based on plant response and soil test results.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Handle with care to avoid dust inhalation and skin contact. Follow safety guidelines for storage and application.</li>
            </ul>
