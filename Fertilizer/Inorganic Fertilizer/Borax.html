        <h1>Borax Fertilizer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Borax is an inorganic compound commonly used as a boron source in fertilizers. It helps correct boron deficiencies in plants, which can lead to improved growth and productivity. Boron is essential for cell wall formation, seed development, and overall plant health.</p>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Borax is most effective in soils that are low in boron. It should be used in soils with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Excessive boron can be harmful, so it is crucial to apply it based on soil testing recommendations.</p>
