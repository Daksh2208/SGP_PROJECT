        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Limestone, specifically Dolomite Lime, is a natural inorganic fertilizer and soil amendment derived from limestone rock. It is primarily used to improve soil pH, enhance soil structure, and provide essential nutrients like calcium and magnesium. Dolomite Lime is valued for its ability to correct soil acidity and promote optimal plant growth.</p>
