        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Osmocote is a well-known slow-release NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) fertilizer designed to provide a steady supply of essential nutrients to plants over an extended period. The slow-release formulation helps ensure consistent plant growth and reduces the need for frequent fertilization.</p>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>For optimal performance, Osmocote should be used in soil conditions that promote nutrient uptake:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil pH:</strong> Works well in a pH range of 6.0-7.0, but can be effective in slightly acidic to neutral soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Type:</strong> Suitable for various soil types including loamy, sandy, and clay soils. Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging and nutrient leaching.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply Osmocote at the beginning of the growing season or during planting. It provides nutrients gradually, reducing the need for additional feedings.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For general use: Typically 2-4 kg per 100 square meters, depending on plant type and growth stage.</li>
                        <li>For container plants: Usually 1-2 tablespoons per container, mixed into the soil or top-dressed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For soil application: Scatter evenly over the soil surface and lightly incorporate into the top layer.</li>
                        <li>For container plants: Mix with potting soil or sprinkle on top and water thoroughly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water plants thoroughly after application to activate the slow-release mechanism.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Regularly check plant growth and adjust application if necessary based on observed plant health.</li>
