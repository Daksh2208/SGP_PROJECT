        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Copper Sulfate (CuSO₄) is a widely used inorganic compound in agriculture, known for its role as a micronutrient and fungicide. It provides essential copper to plants, which is crucial for various physiological processes and disease resistance. Copper Sulfate also helps in controlling fungal diseases in crops and improving overall plant health.</p>
