        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Muriate of Potash (MOP) is a widely used inorganic fertilizer that provides a rich source of potassium, an essential nutrient for plant growth. Composed primarily of potassium chloride (KCl), MOP is known for its effectiveness in promoting robust plant development, improving resistance to diseases, and enhancing overall crop yields. It is one of the most common sources of potassium used in agriculture.</p>
