        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Dicalcium Phosphate (DCP) is a widely used inorganic fertilizer known for its rich phosphorus content and essential calcium. It is commonly used to improve soil fertility, promote root development, and enhance the overall growth of various crops, vegetables, fruits, and flowers. DCP is valued for its ability to provide plants with a steady supply of phosphorus, an essential nutrient for energy transfer and photosynthesis.</p>
