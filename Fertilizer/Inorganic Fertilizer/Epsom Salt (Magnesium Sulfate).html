        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Epsom Salt, chemically known as Magnesium Sulfate, is a popular inorganic fertilizer known for its rich magnesium and sulfur content. It is widely used to improve soil fertility, enhance plant growth, and address magnesium deficiencies in various crops, vegetables, fruits, and flowers. Epsom Salt helps in chlorophyll production, enzyme activation, and nutrient uptake, making it a valuable addition to garden and farm management.</p>
