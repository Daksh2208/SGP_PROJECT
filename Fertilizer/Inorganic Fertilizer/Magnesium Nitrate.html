        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Magnesium Nitrate is an inorganic fertilizer that provides essential magnesium and nitrogen to plants. It is highly soluble in water and is used to correct magnesium deficiencies in various crops. Magnesium Nitrate supports plant growth by enhancing chlorophyll production, improving photosynthesis, and strengthening plant structures.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>For soil application: Incorporate into the soil before planting or as a side-dress during the growing season.</li>
                        <li>For fertigation: Dissolve in water and apply through irrigation systems for efficient nutrient uptake.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water plants thoroughly before and after application to facilitate nutrient absorption.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Regularly monitor plant growth and adjust the dosage based on plant response and soil tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Use protective gear to avoid inhaling dust or contact with skin. Store in a cool, dry place away from children and pets.</li>
