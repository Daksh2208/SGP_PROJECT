        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Mono Potassium Phosphate (MKP) is a water-soluble inorganic fertilizer that provides essential nutrients for plant growth, primarily potassium (K) and phosphorus (P). It is highly soluble in water, making it an excellent choice for fertigation systems and foliar applications. MKP is valued for its ability to support strong root development, enhance flowering, and improve overall plant health.</p>
