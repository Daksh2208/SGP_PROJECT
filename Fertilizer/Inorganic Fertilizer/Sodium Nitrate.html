        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sodium Nitrate (NaNO<sub>3</sub>) is an inorganic compound used primarily as a nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture. It provides plants with a readily available source of nitrogen, which is essential for promoting vigorous growth, chlorophyll production, and overall plant health. Sodium Nitrate is commonly used in various agricultural practices to enhance crop yields and improve soil fertility.</p>

                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For crops: Generally 50-100 kg per hectare, adjusted based on crop type and growth stage.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Typically 20-50 kg per hectare, depending on tree size and nutrient needs.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: Usually 30-70 kg per hectare, tailored to specific plant requirements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For soil application: Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil before planting or during early growth.</li>
                        <li>For fertigation: Dissolve in water and apply through irrigation systems for efficient nutrient uptake.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water the soil well after application to facilitate nutrient absorption and activation.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Monitor plant growth and adjust the dosage based on plant response and soil tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Handle with care to avoid direct contact with skin and eyes. Follow safety guidelines for storage and application.</li>
            </ul>
