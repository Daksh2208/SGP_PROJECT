        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Vermiculite is a naturally occurring mineral that is commonly used as a soil amendment in gardening and agriculture. It is created by heating mica to high temperatures, causing it to expand into lightweight, sponge-like particles. Vermiculite is valued for its ability to improve soil aeration, moisture retention, and nutrient availability.</p>
