        <h1>Boron Fertilizer (Boric Acid): A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Boron Fertilizer, commonly in the form of Boric Acid, is an essential micronutrient used to correct boron deficiencies in crops. Boron plays a crucial role in cell wall formation, sugar transport, and reproductive development in plants. Its application is vital for improving crop yields and quality, especially in boron-deficient soils.</p>
