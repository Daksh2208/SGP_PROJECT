        <h1>Copper Hydroxide (Cu(OH)₂): A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Copper Hydroxide (Cu(OH)₂) is an inorganic compound used primarily as a fungicide and a source of copper in fertilizers. It helps in addressing copper deficiencies in soil, which can lead to improved plant health and yield. Copper is an essential micronutrient that supports various physiological processes in plants.</p>
