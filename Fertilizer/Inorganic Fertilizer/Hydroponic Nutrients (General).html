        <h1>Hydroponic Nutrients: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hydroponic nutrients are specialized inorganic fertilizers designed for use in hydroponic systems, where plants grow without soil. These nutrients are formulated to provide all essential elements required for optimal plant growth and development directly in the nutrient solution. Hydroponic nutrients ensure that plants receive a balanced mix of macronutrients and micronutrients for healthy growth and high yields.</p>

        <section class="nutrient-composition">
            <h2>Nutrient Composition</h2>
            <p>Hydroponic nutrients typically contain the following essential elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen (N):</strong> Promotes leaf and stem growth. Usually present in concentrations of 5-15%.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus (P):</strong> Supports root development and flowering. Generally found in concentrations of 1-10%.</li>
                <li><strong>Potassium (K):</strong> Enhances overall plant health and disease resistance. Commonly included at 5-15% concentrations.</li>
                <li><strong>Calcium (Ca):</strong> Important for cell wall structure and growth. Typically 1-5%.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnesium (Mg):</strong> Essential for photosynthesis and enzyme activation. Found at 1-3%.</li>
                <li><strong>Sulfur (S):</strong> Contributes to protein synthesis and enzyme function. Usually 0.5-2%.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Includes elements such as Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Boron (B), and Molybdenum (Mo) in trace amounts (typically less than 1%).</li>

        </section>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Since hydroponic systems do not use soil, nutrient solution pH and electrical conductivity (EC) are critical for plant health. Maintain pH levels between 5.5 and 6.5 and adjust the EC based on the plant’s growth stage. Regular monitoring and adjustment of these parameters are essential for optimal nutrient uptake.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Hydroponic Nutrients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Mix hydroponic nutrients with water according to the manufacturer’s instructions to achieve the desired nutrient concentration.</li>
                <li><strong>Application:</strong> Add the nutrient solution to the hydroponic system. Ensure even distribution to the plant roots.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Regularly check the pH and EC of the nutrient solution and adjust as needed to maintain optimal conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Replenish or replace the nutrient solution as per the growth stage and plant requirements, typically every 1-2 weeks.</li>
                <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Clean the hydroponic system components periodically to prevent nutrient buildup and system blockages.</li>
            </ul>
