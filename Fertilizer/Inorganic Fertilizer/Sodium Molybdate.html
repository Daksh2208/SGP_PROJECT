        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sodium Molybdate (Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>) is an inorganic compound used as a micronutrient fertilizer in agriculture. It is a vital source of molybdenum, an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in various plant physiological processes, including nitrogen fixation, enzyme activation, and plant metabolism. Sodium Molybdate helps to prevent and correct molybdenum deficiencies in plants.</p>
