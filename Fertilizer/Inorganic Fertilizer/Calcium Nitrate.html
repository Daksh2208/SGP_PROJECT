        <h1>Calcium Nitrate (Ca(NO₃)₂): A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Calcium Nitrate (Ca(NO₃)₂) is a highly soluble inorganic fertilizer that provides both calcium and nitrogen to the soil. It is used to promote plant growth and improve the overall health of crops by addressing calcium deficiencies and enhancing nitrogen availability. Calcium Nitrate is especially beneficial for crops that require high levels of nitrogen and calcium.</p>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Calcium Nitrate is suitable for a wide range of soil types but is particularly effective in soils that are calcium-deficient. It helps in improving soil structure, enhancing root development, and increasing crop yields. It is ideal for both acidic and neutral soils but should be used cautiously in alkaline soils to avoid potential imbalances.</p>

        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Calcium Nitrate (Ca(NO₃)₂)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply Calcium Nitrate during the growing season, preferably in the early stages of crop development or as a side-dressing during active growth phases.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For field crops: 100-150 kg per hectare, adjusted based on soil test results and crop needs.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: 80-120 kg per hectare, considering tree size and soil conditions.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: 50-100 kg per hectare, based on soil fertility and crop requirements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broadcast Calcium Nitrate evenly across the soil and incorporate it with tillage for uniform distribution.</li>
                        <li>For fertigation, dissolve Calcium Nitrate in water and apply through irrigation systems for precise nutrient delivery.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Ensure soil moisture is adequate after application to facilitate nutrient absorption. Avoid overwatering to prevent nutrient leaching.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Monitor plant health and growth regularly. Adjust application rates based on plant response and soil tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Store Calcium Nitrate in a cool, dry place away from moisture. Use appropriate protective gear when handling to avoid contact with skin and eyes.</li>
