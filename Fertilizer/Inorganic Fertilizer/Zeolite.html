        <h1>Zeolite Fertilizer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Zeolite is a naturally occurring mineral that has been utilized as a soil amendment and fertilizer enhancer. Known for its unique porous structure, zeolite improves soil health by enhancing nutrient retention, water holding capacity, and soil aeration. This mineral is used to optimize plant growth and fertility by providing a slow-release source of nutrients and improving soil quality.</p>
