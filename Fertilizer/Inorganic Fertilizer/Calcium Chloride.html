        <h1>Calcium Chloride (CaCl₂): A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Calcium Chloride (CaCl₂) is an inorganic salt that is used as a fertilizer to provide calcium to the soil. It is highly soluble in water, making it effective in delivering calcium to plants quickly. Calcium is essential for plant cell wall structure, root development, and overall plant health.</p>

            <h2>How to Use Calcium Chloride (CaCl₂)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply Calcium Chloride during the growing season when plants are actively growing. It can be used both before planting and as a side-dressing.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For field crops: 50-100 kg per hectare, based on soil test results and crop needs.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: 40-80 kg per hectare, adjusted based on tree size and soil fertility.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: 30-60 kg per hectare, depending on soil calcium levels.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broadcast Calcium Chloride evenly across the soil surface and incorporate with tillage.</li>
