                        <li>For soil application: Typically 200-300 kg per hectare, adjusted based on soil test results and crop needs.</li>
                        <li>For fertigation: Usually 1-2 kg per 1000 liters of irrigation water, tailored to plant requirements and growth stage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For soil application: Incorporate into the soil before planting or as a side-dress during the growing season.</li>
                        <li>For fertigation: Dissolve in water and apply through irrigation systems for efficient nutrient uptake.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water plants thoroughly before and after application to facilitate nutrient absorption.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Regularly monitor plant growth and adjust the dosage based on plant response and soil tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Use protective gear to avoid inhaling dust or contact with skin. Store in a cool, dry place away from children and pets.</li>
