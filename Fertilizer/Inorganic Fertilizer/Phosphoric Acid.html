        <h1>Phosphoric Acid: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Phosphoric Acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) is a key inorganic compound used in agriculture primarily as a source of phosphorus. Phosphorus is essential for plant growth, playing a crucial role in energy transfer, photosynthesis, and the formation of nucleic acids. Phosphoric Acid is often used to produce phosphate fertilizers and can be applied directly to improve soil phosphorus levels.</p>
