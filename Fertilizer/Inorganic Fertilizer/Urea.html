        <h1>Urea Fertilizer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Urea is a widely used inorganic nitrogen fertilizer with a high nitrogen content, typically around 46%. It is produced by synthesizing ammonia and carbon dioxide. Urea is highly soluble in water, making it an efficient source of nitrogen for plants. It plays a crucial role in promoting leaf growth and overall plant development.</p>

        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Urea is effective in various soil conditions, but optimal performance is achieved under the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil Type:</strong> Suitable for a range of soil types, including sandy, loamy, and clay soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil pH:</strong> Works best in soils with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Adjustments may be needed for acidic or alkaline soils to enhance nitrogen availability.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Urea Fertilizer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply Urea during the growing season, preferably in early spring or before major growth periods to ensure optimal nitrogen uptake.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For crops: Typically 100-250 kg per hectare, depending on crop type and soil nitrogen levels.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Generally 50-150 kg per hectare, adjusted based on tree size and nutrient requirements.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: Usually 50-150 kg per hectare, tailored to specific plant needs and growth stages.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broadcast evenly over the soil surface and incorporate into the soil through tillage or cultivation.</li>
                        <li>Apply in planting rows or furrows for more targeted nitrogen delivery.</li>
                        <li>For foliage application, dissolve in water according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions and spray on plant leaves.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water plants and soil thoroughly after application to enhance nitrogen absorption and minimize volatilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Monitor plant growth and soil nitrogen levels. Adjust application rates based on plant response and soil test results.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Handle with care to avoid dust inhalation and skin contact. Follow safety guidelines for storage and application.</li>
            </ul>
