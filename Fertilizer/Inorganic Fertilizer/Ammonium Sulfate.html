        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Ammonium Sulfate is a popular inorganic fertilizer primarily used to provide nitrogen and sulfur to crops. It is highly effective for soils that are deficient in sulfur and can improve the nitrogen content of the soil, enhancing plant growth.</p>
