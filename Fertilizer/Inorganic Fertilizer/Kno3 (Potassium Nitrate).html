        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Potassium Nitrate (KNO3) is an inorganic fertilizer that provides essential nutrients to plants, primarily potassium (K) and nitrogen (N). It is commonly used to enhance plant growth, improve fruit quality, and increase crop yields. Potassium nitrate also helps in various physiological processes in plants, including photosynthesis and water regulation.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>For soil application: Typically 200-300 kg per hectare, adjusted based on crop type and soil test results.</li>
                        <li>For fertigation: Generally 1-2 kg per 1000 liters of irrigation water, depending on plant needs and growth stage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For soil application: Incorporate into the soil before planting or as a side-dress during the growing season.</li>
                        <li>For fertigation: Dissolve in water and apply through irrigation systems for efficient nutrient uptake.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Ensure adequate watering before and after application to facilitate nutrient absorption.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Regularly monitor plant growth and adjust the dosage based on plant response and soil tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Use protective gear to avoid inhaling dust or coming into contact with skin. Store in a cool, dry place away from children and pets.</li>
