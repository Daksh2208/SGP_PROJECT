        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP) is a widely used inorganic fertilizer that supplies essential nutrients to plants. It contains both phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N), making it an effective tool for promoting strong root development and overall plant growth. MAP is valued for its solubility in water and its ability to provide immediate nutrient availability to plants.</p>
