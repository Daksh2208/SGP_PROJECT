        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Zinc Sulfate Heptahydrate (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O) is an inorganic zinc salt commonly used as a soil additive and foliar spray to address zinc deficiencies in crops. It is a white crystalline compound with high solubility in water, making it an effective source of zinc for plants. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that supports various physiological functions in plants, including enzyme activation, protein synthesis, and chlorophyll production.</p>

                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For crops: Typically 10-25 kg per hectare, adjusted based on soil test results and crop needs.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Usually 5-15 kg per hectare, depending on tree size and nutrient requirements.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: Generally 5-10 kg per hectare, tailored to specific plant needs and soil conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For soil application: Broadcast evenly over the soil surface and incorporate into the soil through tillage or cultivation.</li>
                        <li>For foliar application: Dissolve in water according to the manufacturer’s instructions and spray evenly on plant leaves, ideally in the early morning or late afternoon.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water the soil thoroughly after application to enhance zinc absorption by plant roots. For foliar applications, ensure thorough coverage of leaf surfaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Monitor plant growth and leaf symptoms for signs of zinc deficiency. Adjust application rates and frequencies based on plant response and soil test results.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Use protective equipment when handling and applying Zinc Sulfate Heptahydrate. Avoid inhalation of dust and contact with skin and eyes. Store in a dry, cool place.</li>
