        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sulfur Fertilizer is a key nutrient source used in agriculture to enhance plant growth and improve soil health. Sulfur is an essential macronutrient that supports protein synthesis, enzyme function, and chlorophyll production in plants. It also helps in reducing soil pH, which can improve nutrient availability and overall soil fertility.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply sulfur fertilizer before planting or during early plant growth to improve soil conditions and nutrient availability.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For crops: Typically 20-40 kg per hectare, adjusted based on soil test results and crop requirements.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Generally 10-30 kg per hectare, depending on tree size and soil conditions.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: Usually 15-25 kg per hectare, tailored to specific plant needs and growth conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broadcast evenly over the soil surface and incorporate into the soil using tillage or cultivation equipment.</li>
                        <li>For fertigation: Dissolve in water and apply through irrigation systems for targeted nutrient delivery.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water the soil thoroughly after application to facilitate sulfur activation and absorption by plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Monitor plant response and soil pH regularly. Adjust the dosage and frequency based on soil tests and plant needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Handle with care to avoid direct contact with skin and eyes. Follow safety guidelines for storage and application.</li>
