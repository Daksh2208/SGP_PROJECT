        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) is a widely used inorganic fertilizer known for its high phosphorus and nitrogen content. It is commonly used to promote vigorous plant growth, improve root development, and enhance flowering and fruiting in various crops. DAP is valued for its ability to improve soil fertility and boost plant nutrient availability.</p>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>DAP is effective in a range of soil types, especially those deficient in phosphorus. It is suitable for both acidic and alkaline soils. However, it is essential to conduct a soil test to determine phosphorus levels and avoid over-application. Proper application ensures optimal nutrient uptake and minimizes the risk of nutrient imbalances.</p>
