        <h1>Iron Chelate: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Iron Chelate is a type of inorganic fertilizer designed to provide plants with a readily available form of iron. Iron is a crucial micronutrient that plays a vital role in chlorophyll synthesis and overall plant health. Iron Chelates are used to correct iron deficiencies in plants, which can lead to chlorosis (yellowing of leaves) and reduced growth.</p>

        <!-- Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers -->
        <section class="crop-info">
            <h2>Best for Crops, Vegetables, Fruits, and Flowers</h2>
            <p>Iron Chelate is beneficial for a wide range of plants, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crops:</strong> Corn, Soybeans, Wheat, Rice</li>
                <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Apples, Citrus, Grapes, Strawberries</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Tomatoes, Lettuce, Peppers, Cucumbers</li>
                <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Roses, Tulips, Geraniums, Marigolds</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Nutrient Composition -->
        <section class="nutrient-composition">
            <h2>Nutrient Composition</h2>
            <p>Iron Chelates are formulated to deliver iron in a form that is easily absorbed by plants. Key components include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Iron (Fe):</strong> Typically provided in concentrations ranging from 5% to 15%, depending on the formulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Chelating Agents:</strong> Substances such as EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), or EDDHA (ethylenediamine-N,N'-bis(2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid)) that bind iron and enhance its availability to plants.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Iron Chelate is most effective when soil pH is within the optimal range for iron availability, generally between 5.5 and 6.5. Iron deficiencies are more common in alkaline soils where iron becomes less available. Regular soil testing can help determine pH levels and guide the use of Iron Chelate to address deficiencies.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Iron Chelate</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply Iron Chelate during the growing season, especially when plants show signs of iron deficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For crops: Typically 1-2 kg per hectare, adjusted based on specific crop needs and soil conditions.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Usually 0.5-1 kg per hectare, considering tree size and iron deficiency levels.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: Generally 0.5-1 kg per hectare, tailored to the severity of the deficiency and plant requirements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mix Iron Chelate with water according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.</li>
                        <li>Apply as a soil drench or foliar spray, depending on the product and plant needs.</li>
                        <li>Avoid application during the hottest part of the day to prevent potential damage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Ensure adequate watering before and after application to facilitate the uptake of iron by plant roots.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Observe plant response and adjust application frequency and dosage based on visual symptoms and soil test results.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Use protective equipment to avoid inhalation or skin contact. Store Iron Chelate in a cool, dry place away from children and pets.</li>
