        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sulfate of Potash (SOP), also known as potassium sulfate, is an inorganic compound used as a potassium fertilizer in agriculture. It provides plants with potassium, an essential nutrient that supports various physiological functions, including water regulation, enzyme activation, and disease resistance. SOP is favored for its low chloride content, making it suitable for crops sensitive to chloride.</p>
