        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Ferrous Sulfate, also known as Iron(II) sulfate, is a widely used inorganic fertilizer that provides essential iron to plants. It is commonly used to correct iron deficiencies, which can lead to chlorosis (yellowing of leaves) and reduced plant growth. Ferrous Sulfate helps improve soil fertility and enhance plant health, making it a valuable tool for gardeners and farmers.</p>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Ferrous Sulfate</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply Ferrous Sulfate during early growth stages or when iron deficiency symptoms are observed.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For field crops: 50-100 kg per hectare, based on soil tests and plant needs.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: 20-40 kg per hectare, adjusted according to tree size and soil conditions.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: 10-30 kg per hectare, tailored to specific plant requirements and soil tests.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broadcast Ferrous Sulfate evenly over the soil surface and incorporate it using tillage equipment.</li>
                        <li>For foliar application, dissolve Ferrous Sulfate in water and spray directly onto plant leaves for rapid iron absorption.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Ensure the soil is adequately moist after application to enhance nutrient uptake and prevent iron fixation.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Observe plant growth and leaf color to gauge effectiveness. Adjust application rates based on plant response and soil tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Use protective gear when handling Ferrous Sulfate. Store in a dry, cool place to prevent moisture absorption.</li>
            </ul>
