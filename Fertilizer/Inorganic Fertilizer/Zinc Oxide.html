        <h1>Zinc Oxide Fertilizer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Zinc Oxide is an inorganic compound commonly used as a micronutrient fertilizer in agriculture. It provides a vital source of zinc, an essential element for plant growth and development. Zinc plays a crucial role in enzyme function, protein synthesis, and chlorophyll production, making it integral for healthy plant metabolism and yield.</p>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Zinc Oxide is effective under the following soil conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil Type:</strong> Suitable for a wide range of soil types, including sandy, loamy, and clay soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil pH:</strong> Most effective in soils with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Zinc availability decreases in alkaline soils, so adjustments may be needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Zinc Oxide Fertilizer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply Zinc Oxide before planting or during the growing season to correct zinc deficiencies and support plant health.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For crops: Typically 5-10 kg per hectare, adjusted based on soil zinc levels and crop requirements.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Usually 3-7 kg per hectare, depending on tree size and nutrient needs.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: Generally 2-5 kg per hectare, tailored to specific plant needs and soil conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broadcast evenly over the soil surface and incorporate into the soil through tillage or cultivation.</li>
                        <li>Alternatively, mix with water for foliar application, ensuring even coverage on plant leaves.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water the soil thoroughly after application to dissolve the zinc and enhance its uptake by plant roots.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Regularly monitor plant growth and soil zinc levels. Adjust application rates based on plant response and soil tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Handle with care to avoid dust inhalation and skin contact. Follow safety guidelines for storage and application.</li>
            </ul>
