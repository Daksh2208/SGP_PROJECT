        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Superphosphate is a type of inorganic phosphate fertilizer used to enhance soil phosphorus levels, which is essential for plant growth and development. It is made by treating phosphate rock with sulfuric acid, resulting in a fertilizer rich in phosphorus. Superphosphate improves root development, flowering, and overall plant health by providing a readily available source of phosphorus.</p>

        <!-- Soil Condition Requirements -->
        <section class="soil-condition">
            <h2>Soil Condition Requirements</h2>
            <p>Superphosphate is effective under the following soil conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil Type:</strong> Suitable for various soil types, including sandy, loamy, and clay soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil pH:</strong> Works well in soils with a pH range of 5.5 to 7.0. For highly acidic or alkaline soils, additional soil amendments may be needed to optimize phosphorus availability.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Application Methods -->
        <section class="usage">
            <h2>How to Use Superphosphate</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply Superphosphate before planting or during the early stages of plant growth to ensure phosphorus availability for root development.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For crops: Typically 50-100 kg per hectare, adjusted based on soil test results and crop needs.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: Usually 25-75 kg per hectare, considering tree size and nutrient requirements.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: Generally 30-60 kg per hectare, tailored to specific plant needs and soil conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broadcast evenly over the soil surface and incorporate into the soil through tillage or cultivation.</li>
                        <li>Apply in furrows or planting holes for more targeted nutrient placement.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Water the soil thoroughly after application to help dissolve the phosphate and facilitate nutrient uptake by plant roots.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Monitor plant growth and soil phosphorus levels. Adjust application rates based on plant response and soil test results.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Handle with care to avoid dust inhalation and contact with skin. Follow safety guidelines for storage and application.</li>
            </ul>
