            <h2>How to Use Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application Timing:</strong> Apply CAN during the growing season when plants are actively developing. It can be used both as a pre-planting and a side-dressing application.</li>
                <li><strong>Dosage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For field crops: 100-150 kg per hectare, based on soil tests and crop needs.</li>
                        <li>For fruit trees: 80-120 kg per hectare, depending on tree size and soil fertility.</li>
                        <li>For vegetables: 60-100 kg per hectare, adjusted according to soil and plant requirements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broadcast CAN evenly across the soil surface before planting and incorporate it with tillage.</li>
                        <li>Use side-dressing techniques during the growing season to provide additional nutrients.</li>
                        <li>Foliar applications can also be effective for quick nutrient uptake.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Watering and Activation:</strong> Ensure adequate soil moisture after application to facilitate nutrient absorption. Avoid overwatering to prevent leaching.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Regularly monitor plant growth and soil conditions. Adjust application rates based on crop needs and soil test results.</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Store CAN in a cool, dry place. Avoid applying before heavy rain to prevent nutrient runoff.</li>
            </ul>
