            <h2>1. What is Cocoa?</h2>
            <p>Cocoa, derived from the cacao tree (*Theobroma cacao*), is a key ingredient in chocolate production. The seeds from the cocoa pod are processed to produce cocoa mass, cocoa butter, and cocoa powder, all essential for the chocolate industry.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of Cocoa</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Cocoa trees are small to medium-sized trees that produce pods containing 20-60 seeds (beans). The pods are leathery and can be green, yellow, or reddish-brown when ripe.</li>
                <li><strong>Varieties:</strong> The main cocoa varieties are Forastero (common and high-yielding), Criollo (rare and fine-flavored), and Trinitario (a hybrid).</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Cocoa beans are rich in antioxidants, flavonoids, and essential minerals like magnesium and iron, making them valuable for health and wellness products.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Cocoa</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Cocoa thrives in hot, humid, tropical climates, typically within 20° of the Equator. The ideal temperature is between 68°F and 90°F (20°C to 32°C), with annual rainfall of 1000-2500 mm.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Cocoa requires deep, well-drained soils that are rich in organic matter. A slightly acidic pH between 5.0 and 6.5 is ideal.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Cocoa seedlings or grafted plants should be planted at the onset of the rainy season. Space them about 3 meters apart. Shade trees may be needed during the early stages of growth.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Cocoa</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> While cocoa trees require regular rainfall, supplemental irrigation may be needed during dry periods. The soil should remain moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Fertilize cocoa trees with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium-based fertilizers, along with organic matter like compost. Soil testing is recommended to apply the right amount of nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Common pests include cocoa pod borer, aphids, and capsid bugs. Use integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, including biological control agents and organic pesticides, to minimize crop damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Cocoa is susceptible to fungal diseases like black pod and witches' broom. Pruning, good field hygiene, and fungicide application can help manage these issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Cocoa</h2>
            <p>Cocoa pods take about 5-6 months to mature after flowering. Harvesting is done manually using a sharp tool to cut the pods from the tree without damaging the plant. The beans are then extracted from the pods, fermented for 5-7 days, and dried before being processed further.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Cocoa</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Culinary:</strong> Cocoa is the primary ingredient in chocolate production. Cocoa powder is also used in beverages, baking, and confectionery items.</li>
                <li><strong>Cosmetic:</strong> Cocoa butter, extracted from cocoa beans, is widely used in skincare products due to its moisturizing properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Cocoa is rich in antioxidants and has been associated with cardiovascular benefits, improved mood, and anti-inflammatory effects.</li>
            </ul>
