            <h2>1. What are Chickpeas?</h2>
            <p>Chickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans, are a type of legume belonging to the Fabaceae family. They are widely grown for their edible seeds, which are rich in protein, fiber, and essential nutrients.</p>

            <h2>2. Characteristics of Chickpeas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Chickpea plants are bushy with small, feathery leaves. The seeds are round and beige, though some varieties have darker seeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Varieties:</strong> There are two main types: desi (small, darker seeds) and kabuli (larger, lighter seeds), each used in different cuisines around the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Chickpeas are high in protein, dietary fiber, and key minerals such as iron, phosphorus, and magnesium.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Cultivation of Chickpeas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Chickpeas grow best in cool, dry climates. The ideal temperature for growth is between 50°F and 85°F (10°C to 29°C). They are relatively drought-tolerant but sensitive to frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Chickpeas prefer well-drained, loamy soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. They thrive in moderately fertile soils but can fix their own nitrogen, reducing the need for fertilizers.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Chickpeas should be planted in early spring or late winter, as they prefer cool growing conditions. Sow seeds directly in the soil, spacing them about 6 inches apart in rows.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Chickpeas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Chickpeas are relatively drought-resistant and require less water than many other crops. Water during the early stages of growth and flowering, but avoid overwatering to prevent root diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Since chickpeas are nitrogen-fixing plants, they don’t require much nitrogen fertilizer. However, applying phosphorus at planting can enhance growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Common pests include aphids, pod borers, and cutworms. Use integrated pest management techniques, including natural predators and crop rotation, to minimize pest damage.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Chickpeas</h2>
            <p>Chickpeas are ready to harvest when the pods turn brown and dry. This usually occurs 90-100 days after planting. Harvest by pulling the entire plant or by cutting the pods from the plants. Allow the pods to dry completely before threshing and storing the seeds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Chickpeas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Culinary:</strong> Chickpeas are widely used in dishes like hummus, salads, soups, and stews. They can also be ground into flour (gram flour) and used in baking or frying.</li>
                <li><strong>Preservation:</strong> Chickpeas can be dried for long-term storage or canned for convenience. Dried chickpeas must be soaked before cooking.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Chickpeas are rich in protein and fiber, making them ideal for promoting heart health, digestive health, and managing blood sugar levels.</li>
