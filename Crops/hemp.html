            <h2>1. What is Hemp?</h2>
            <p>Hemp (*Cannabis sativa*) is a versatile plant grown for its industrial uses, such as fiber, seeds, and oil. While it belongs to the same species as cannabis, hemp contains low levels of the psychoactive compound THC and is cultivated for its industrial and medicinal applications.</p>

        <div class="section" id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of Hemp</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Hemp plants grow tall and fibrous, reaching heights of 6-15 feet. The leaves are narrow, serrated, and palmate in shape. The stalks are the primary source of fiber, while the seeds are used for oil and food products.</li>
                <li><strong>Varieties:</strong> Hemp is grown for fiber, seeds, or CBD oil extraction. The variety selected depends on the intended use, with different strains developed for specific purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Uses:</strong> Hemp is widely used in textiles, biodegradable plastics, food products, paper, construction materials, biofuels, and health supplements (CBD oil).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Hemp</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Hemp grows best in warm, temperate climates with plenty of sunlight. It requires 70째F to 80째F (21째C to 27째C) for optimal growth and is relatively tolerant of a range of conditions, but it thrives in environments with well-distributed rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Hemp prefers well-drained, loamy soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. It requires good soil fertility, and adding organic matter improves soil health and yields.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Hemp is usually direct-seeded into fields after the last frost. Seeds are sown about 1 inch deep, with spacing depending on whether the crop is grown for fiber, seeds, or CBD oil. Dense planting is used for fiber production, while wider spacing is better for seed and oil production.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Hemp</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Hemp requires moderate water, with more frequent irrigation during its initial growth stages. Once established, it is relatively drought-resistant, but consistent moisture is necessary for high yields.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Hemp is a nutrient-demanding crop, especially in nitrogen. Use a balanced fertilizer or organic compost to ensure optimal growth. Fertilizers with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) are ideal.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> While hemp is naturally resistant to many pests, it can be affected by aphids, spider mites, and caterpillars. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies, including the use of beneficial insects, crop rotation, and organic pesticides, are effective.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Hemp is susceptible to fungal diseases like mold, root rot, and blight, especially in damp conditions. Proper spacing, crop rotation, and using disease-resistant varieties help reduce the risk of infection.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Hemp</h2>
            <p>Hemp is harvested for fiber when the plants are in the flowering stage, typically 70-90 days after planting. For seed and oil production, harvesting occurs once the seeds begin to mature, about 4-6 months after planting. Harvesting methods vary depending on the intended use, with fiber crops requiring cutting of the stalks and seed crops requiring careful handling to avoid seed loss.</p>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Hemp</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Textile and Fiber:</strong> Hemp fibers are strong and durable, used to produce ropes, clothing, biodegradable plastics, and paper.</li>
                <li><strong>Food and Oil:</strong> Hemp seeds are a source of protein and healthy oils, used in health foods, supplements, and cosmetics. The seeds can be pressed to extract hemp oil.</li>
                <li><strong>CBD and Medicinal Uses:</strong> Hemp is used to extract cannabidiol (CBD), which has various medicinal applications, including pain relief, anxiety reduction, and anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Construction Materials:</strong> Hemp is used to produce eco-friendly building materials like hempcrete, which is a sustainable alternative to concrete.</li>
