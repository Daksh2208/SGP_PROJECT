            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Endive</h2>
            <img src="Endive.jpg" alt="Endive Planting">
            <p>Endive is a leafy green vegetable that thrives in cooler weather. The best seasons for growing endive are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Sow seeds in early spring (March to April) for a summer harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> For a fall harvest, plant seeds in late summer (July to August). Endive improves in flavor after exposure to cooler temperatures.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,endive" alt="Soil for Endive"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Endive prefers well-drained, fertile soils rich in organic matter. Loamy soil is ideal for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for endive is between 6.0 and 7.5, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure into the soil to enhance fertility and moisture retention.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,endive" alt="Fertilizer for Endive"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting to provide essential nutrients for healthy growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost or well-rotted manure to enrich the soil and improve plant health.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Side-dress with nitrogen-rich fertilizers (such as fish emulsion) during the growing season to promote leafy growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Endive</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?endive,disease" alt="Diseases in Endive"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease causing yellow spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve air circulation and use resistant varieties. Fungicides can also help.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> Fungal disease resulting in white powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Avoid overhead watering and use fungicides if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Small sap-sucking insects that can lead to stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticidal soap or neem oil to manage infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?endive,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate endive with other crops to prevent soil-borne diseases and pest buildup.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Regularly remove weeds to minimize competition for nutrients and to reduce pest habitats.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Clear away debris and diseased plants from the garden to reduce the risk of disease outbreaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Water plants early in the day and at the base to minimize moisture on leaves.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?endive,care" alt="Care for Endive"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Endive grows best in temperatures between 60-70°F (15-21°C). High temperatures can cause it to bolt.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Endive requires consistent moisture, especially during hot weather. Water regularly to keep the soil evenly moist.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space endive plants about 12-18 inches apart to allow adequate air circulation and prevent overcrowding.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and slugs. Use organic pest control measures and encourage beneficial insects.</li>
