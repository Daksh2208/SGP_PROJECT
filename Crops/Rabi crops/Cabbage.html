            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Cabbage</h2>
            <img src="Cabbage.avif" alt="Cabbage Planting">
            <p>Cabbage is a cool-season crop that grows best in mild temperatures. It thrives in temperatures between 60-70째F (15-21째C). The best seasons for growing cabbage are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plant cabbage in early spring (March to April) for a summer harvest. Start seeds indoors or sow directly outdoors after the last frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Plant cabbage in late summer (July to August) for a fall or early winter harvest. Cooler temperatures improve the flavor and texture of the heads.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,cabbage" alt="Soil for Cabbage"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Cabbage prefers well-drained, loamy soils rich in organic matter. Heavy clay soils should be amended with compost to improve drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for cabbage is between 6.0 and 7.5, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure into the soil before planting to provide the necessary nutrients for optimal growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Cabbage</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,cabbage" alt="Fertilizer for Cabbage"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting time to promote strong leaf growth and head formation.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Compost and well-rotted manure are ideal organic options to enrich the soil and improve cabbage yield.</li>
                <li><strong>Side Dressing:</strong> Apply a nitrogen-rich fertilizer once plants are established to encourage leafy growth, particularly during the early stages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Cabbage</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cabbage,disease" alt="Diseases in Cabbage"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Black Rot:</strong> A bacterial disease that causes yellowing and wilting of leaves, and black veins. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use disease-free seeds and practice crop rotation to prevent its spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Clubroot:</strong> A soil-borne disease causing swollen, distorted roots and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and maintain proper soil pH levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that affects the leaves, causing yellow patches and white mold on the underside. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and avoid overhead watering.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cabbage,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate cabbage with non-brassica crops (such as legumes or grains) to prevent the buildup of soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris after harvest and avoid planting cabbage in the same spot for consecutive years to prevent disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space cabbage plants 12-24 inches apart to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity, minimizing fungal disease risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Water at the base of the plant, avoiding wetting the leaves, to reduce the risk of fungal infections like downy mildew.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cabbage,care" alt="Care for Cabbage"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Cabbage thrives in cooler temperatures between 60-70째F (15-21째C). Prolonged heat can cause heads to split or form poorly.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Cabbage requires consistent moisture, particularly during head formation. Water deeply and regularly to keep the soil evenly moist.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space cabbage plants 12-24 inches apart, with rows 2-3 feet apart, depending on the variety, to ensure proper growth and air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as cabbage worms, aphids, and flea beetles. Use organic control methods like neem oil or introduce beneficial insects to manage pest populations.</li>
            </ul>
