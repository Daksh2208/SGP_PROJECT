            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Cauliflower</h2>
            <img src="cauliflower-field.jpeg" alt="Cauliflower Planting">
            <p>Cauliflower is a cool-season crop that grows best in temperatures between 60-70째F (15-21째C). The best seasons for growing cauliflower are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plant cauliflower in early spring (March to May) for a summer harvest. Start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Plant cauliflower in late summer (August to September) for a fall or early winter harvest. Cooler temperatures help improve the quality of the heads.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,cauliflower" alt="Soil for Cauliflower"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Cauliflower prefers well-drained, loamy soils rich in organic matter. Ensure the soil is loose to promote proper root development.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for cauliflower is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure into the soil before planting to provide essential nutrients and improve moisture retention.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Cauliflower</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,cauliflower" alt="Fertilizer for Cauliflower"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) during planting to provide the necessary nutrients for healthy growth and head formation.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Compost and well-rotted manure are great organic options for enriching the soil and promoting growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Side Dressing:</strong> Once the plants are established, apply a nitrogen-rich fertilizer to promote leaf and head development.</li>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Cauliflower</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cauliflower,disease" alt="Diseases in Cauliflower"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clubroot:</strong> A soil-borne disease that causes swollen, distorted roots and stunted plant growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and maintain proper soil pH (above 7.2) to reduce the risk of infection.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that causes yellow spots on leaves and white mold on the undersides. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve air circulation, avoid overhead watering, and use fungicides if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Black Rot:</strong> A bacterial disease causing yellowing, wilting, and black veins in leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use disease-free seeds and practice crop rotation to minimize its spread.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cauliflower,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate cauliflower with non-brassica crops (like legumes or grains) to prevent soil-borne diseases and reduce pest pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris after harvest to reduce the risk of pest and disease buildup in the field.</li>
                <li><strong>Blanching:</strong> To keep the cauliflower heads white and tender, tie the leaves over the heads when they are about 2-3 inches in diameter.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Use drip irrigation or water at the base of the plant to avoid wetting the leaves, reducing the risk of fungal infections.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cauliflower,care" alt="Care for Cauliflower"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Cauliflower grows best in cool weather, with an ideal temperature range of 60-70째F (15-21째C). Avoid heat, as it can cause heads to bolt or develop poorly.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Cauliflower requires consistent moisture to develop healthy heads. Water deeply and regularly, especially during dry periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants about 18-24 inches apart in rows that are 24-36 inches apart to allow for proper growth and air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids, cabbage worms, and flea beetles. Use row covers to protect young plants and apply organic insecticides if necessary.</li>
