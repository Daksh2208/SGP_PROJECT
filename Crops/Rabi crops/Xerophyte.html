            <h2>1. What are Xerophytes?</h2>
            <p>Xerophytes are plants that have adapted to survive in environments with little water, such as deserts and arid regions. They possess unique features that allow them to conserve water and thrive under drought conditions.</p>

        <div class="section" id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of Xerophytes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Storage:</strong> Xerophytes often store water in their stems or leaves to use during dry periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Leaf Surface Area:</strong> Many have small or modified leaves (like spines) to minimize water loss through transpiration.</li>
                <li><strong>Thick Cuticle:</strong> A waxy coating on leaves and stems helps reduce water evaporation.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Root Systems:</strong> These plants often develop extensive root systems to access deeper water sources.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Habitat of Xerophytes</h2>
            <p>Xerophytes are commonly found in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deserts</li>
                <li>Rocky outcrops</li>
                <li>Dry grasslands</li>
                <li>Coastal dunes</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Xerophytes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Xerophytes require minimal watering. Water thoroughly but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Use well-draining soil to prevent root rot. A mix of sand, gravel, and potting soil is often ideal.</li>
                <li><strong>Light:</strong> Most xerophytes thrive in full sunlight, so provide plenty of light exposure.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Xerophytes are generally heat-tolerant but may need protection from extreme cold.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Common Examples of Xerophytes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cacti:</strong> These iconic plants are well-known for their water-storing capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Aloe Vera:</strong> This succulent plant has thick leaves that retain moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Agave:</strong> Known for its rosette shape and spiky leaves, agave can survive with very little water.</li>
                <li><strong>Succulents:</strong> Many succulents, such as jade plants, are adapted to dry environments.</li>
            </ul>
