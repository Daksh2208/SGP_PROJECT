            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Drumsticks</h2>
            <img src="drumstick-tree.jpeg" alt="Drumstick Planting">
            <p>Drumstick, also known as Moringa, is a fast-growing tree that thrives in warm climates. The best seasons for growing drumsticks are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> The ideal time to plant drumstick seeds is in early spring (March to April) when the soil temperature is warm enough for germination.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> In warm regions, drumsticks can be planted in late spring to early summer (May to June) to take advantage of the growing season.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,drumstick" alt="Soil for Drumstick"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Drumsticks prefer well-drained sandy or loamy soils. They are tolerant of poor soil conditions but thrive in fertile soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for drumsticks ranges from 6.0 to 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to improve nutrient content and drainage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Drumsticks</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,drumstick" alt="Fertilizer for Drumstick"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Incorporate well-rotted manure or compost into the soil before planting to provide essential nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizer:</strong> A balanced NPK fertilizer (10-10-10) can be applied during the growing season to enhance growth and productivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Ensure the soil has sufficient micronutrients like magnesium and iron, as deficiencies can affect growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Drumsticks</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?drumstick,disease" alt="Diseases in Drumsticks"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Fungal disease causing dark spots on leaves, leading to leaf drop. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and practice proper sanitation by removing affected leaves.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Caused by waterlogged conditions, leading to wilting and plant decline. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid overwatering.</li>
                <li><strong>White Flies:</strong> Insects that feed on sap, causing yellowing and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticidal soap or neem oil to manage infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?drumstick,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate drumsticks with other crops to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases and pests.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Regularly remove weeds to minimize competition for nutrients and prevent pests from hiding in the vegetation.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Keep the planting area clean by removing plant debris and maintaining good hygiene to prevent disease outbreaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Water plants at the base and avoid wetting the foliage to reduce the risk of fungal diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?drumstick,care" alt="Care for Drumstick"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Drumsticks prefer warm temperatures between 70-95°F (21-35°C) and are sensitive to frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water young plants regularly to establish roots. Once mature, they are drought-tolerant but still require occasional watering during dry spells.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space drumstick trees 8-10 feet apart to allow for proper growth and air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic methods such as neem oil or insecticidal soap to manage infestations.</li>
