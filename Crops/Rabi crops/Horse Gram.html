            <p>Horse gram is a drought-resistant legume that grows well in warm climates. The best seasons for growing horse gram are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> Horse gram is typically sown after the monsoon season (August to September) for a winter harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Winter:</strong> In some regions, it can also be grown in winter (October to November) for harvest in early spring.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Horse gram thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils with good fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for horse gram is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter such as compost to improve soil structure and fertility.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost or well-rotted manure to enhance soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphate Fertilizers:</strong> Apply phosphorus-rich fertilizers (like single superphosphate) at planting to promote root development.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Use a nitrogen-rich fertilizer during flowering for increased pod and seed yield.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease causing white powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and apply fungicides as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Caused by waterlogged conditions leading to wilting and plant death. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid overwatering.</li>
                <li><strong>Stem Blight:</strong> A disease that affects the stems, causing them to decay. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Rotate crops and remove infected plants.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate horse gram with non-legume crops to reduce soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field free of weeds to prevent competition for nutrients and moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and diseased plants to minimize disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Water at the base of the plants and avoid excessive moisture on foliage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?horsegram,care" alt="Care for Horse Gram"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Horse gram grows best in temperatures between 70-85°F (21-29°C) and is drought-resistant.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water sparingly, as horse gram is drought-tolerant. Ensure moisture during germination.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space horse gram seeds about 6-8 inches apart in rows 1-2 feet apart for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic pest control methods as needed.</li>
