            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Kidney Beans</h2>
            <img src="Kidney Beans.avif" alt="Kidney Beans Field">
            <p>Kidney beans are primarily grown in warm weather. The planting season varies based on the climate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring Planting:</strong> Planted after the last frost in early spring and harvested in late summer (June to August).</li>
                <li><strong>Fall Planting:</strong> In warmer climates, kidney beans can be planted in early fall and harvested before the first frost.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Kidney beans thrive in well-drained, loamy soils that are rich in organic matter. Avoid clay or waterlogged soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for kidney beans is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and drainage.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="fertilizer">
            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Kidney Beans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Use fertilizers rich in phosphorus and potassium to promote strong root and pod development.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Fixation:</strong> Kidney beans fix their own nitrogen, so avoid excess nitrogen fertilizers, which can hinder pod formation.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Matter:</strong> Apply compost to improve soil structure and provide slow-release nutrients.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="diseases">
            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Kidney Beans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anthracnose:</strong> A fungal disease causing dark lesions on stems and pods. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use certified disease-free seeds and rotate crops.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Affects the roots and causes wilting. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid overwatering.</li>
                <li><strong>Bacterial Blight:</strong> Causes yellowing and spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply copper-based fungicides and practice good field sanitation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultural-practices">
            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate kidney beans with non-leguminous crops to reduce disease build-up in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant debris to prevent disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep fields weed-free to prevent pests and diseases from taking hold.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Water moderately and avoid waterlogged conditions to prevent root rot.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Select disease-resistant kidney bean varieties to reduce the risk of infections.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Kidney beans grow best in temperatures between 65째F and 85째F (18째C to 29째C). Avoid planting during frost or extreme heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water consistently, especially during flowering and pod formation, but avoid waterlogging the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space kidney bean plants 4-6 inches apart with rows 18-24 inches apart to allow for proper air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and bean beetles, and use organic pest control methods if necessary.</li>
