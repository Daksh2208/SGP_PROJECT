            <p>Jowar is a drought-resistant cereal crop that thrives in warm climates. The best seasons for growing jowar are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kharif Season:</strong> Sown in the rainy season (June to August) and harvested in late autumn (October to November).</li>
                <li><strong>Rabi Season:</strong> In some regions, it can also be grown in the post-monsoon season (November to January) for an early spring harvest.</li>
            </ul>
