            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Beetroot</h2>
            <img src="beetroot-field.jpeg" alt="Beetroot Planting">
            <p>Beetroot is a cool-season vegetable that grows best in mild temperatures. It can tolerate light frost but not extreme heat. The best seasons for growing beetroot are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plant beetroot in early spring (March to April) for a summer harvest. In cooler regions, sow as soon as the soil can be worked.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Beetroot can be planted in late summer (August to September) for a fall or early winter harvest.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,beetroot" alt="Soil for Beetroot"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Beetroot thrives in well-drained, loamy soils rich in organic matter. Avoid compacted or heavy clay soils, which can hinder root development.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for beetroot is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Work compost or well-rotted manure into the soil to improve fertility and ensure loose soil for root expansion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Beetroot</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,beetroot" alt="Fertilizer for Beetroot"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> A balanced fertilizer like 10-10-10 or 5-10-10 provides essential nutrients for strong root and leaf growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Incorporate organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure to enhance soil structure and promote healthy beetroot growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Phosphorus (P) encourages root development, and potassium (K) helps improve beet size and sweetness.</li>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?beetroot,disease" alt="Diseases in Beetroot"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that affects leaves, causing yellowish patches and fuzzy mold growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and improve air circulation around plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> A fungal infection that results in brown or black spots on leaves, reducing photosynthesis. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and practice crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Caused by waterlogged soils, leading to decaying roots and poor crop yield. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid overwatering.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?beetroot,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate beetroot with non-root crops to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases and pests.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Maintain a weed-free field during early beetroot growth to avoid competition for nutrients and water.</                </li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Thin seedlings to avoid overcrowding, allowing for proper air circulation and reducing the risk of fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Water consistently but avoid waterlogging. Use drip irrigation or water at the base to minimize leaf wetness.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and diseased leaves promptly to minimize disease spread.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?beetroot,care" alt="Care for Beetroot"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Beetroot grows best in temperatures between 50-70°F (10-21°C). It can tolerate light frosts but should be protected from extreme cold and heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist, especially during root formation. Avoid letting the soil dry out, which can lead to woody or undersized beets.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space beetroot plants about 3-4 inches apart in rows that are 12-18 inches apart to allow for proper growth and air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids, beet leaf miners, and flea beetles. Use organic pest control methods like neem oil or introduce beneficial insects to control infestations.</li>
