            <p>Lettuce is a cool-season crop that prefers temperate conditions. The best seasons for growing lettuce are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Sown in early spring (March to May) for a spring harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> In many regions, it can also be planted in late summer (August to September) for a fall harvest.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Lettuce thrives in well-drained, loamy soils rich in organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for lettuce is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure into the soil to enhance fertility and moisture retention.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,lettuce" alt="Fertilizer for Lettuce"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and promote healthy leaf development.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Apply a nitrogen-rich fertilizer during active growth to enhance leaf production.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that causes yellow spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and fungicides as necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Gray Mold:</strong> A disease that affects the plant during high humidity, leading to a grayish mold on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve air circulation and avoid overhead watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Small insects that feed on the sap of lettuce plants, leading to wilting. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticidal soap or neem oil for management.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate lettuce with non-cabbage crops to reduce disease risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field free of weeds to prevent competition for nutrients and moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and diseased plants from the field to minimize disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Water at the base of the plants and avoid wetting foliage to reduce fungal infections.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Lettuce grows best in temperatures between 60-70°F (15-21°C) and can bolt in high heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Lettuce requires consistent moisture, especially during hot weather; avoid drying out between watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space lettuce plants about 10-12 inches apart in rows that are 12-18 inches apart for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like slugs and snails, employing organic pest control methods as needed.</li>
