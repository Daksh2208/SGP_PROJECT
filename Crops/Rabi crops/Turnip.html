            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Turnips</h2>
            <img src="turnip-field.jpeg" alt="Turnip Field">
            <p>Turnips thrive in cool-weather conditions and can be grown in both spring and fall. The best seasons for growing turnips are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plant turnips in early spring (March to May) when temperatures are cooler to ensure optimal root formation.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Turnips can be planted in late summer or early fall (August to October) for a late-season harvest.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,turnip" alt="Soil for Turnips"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Turnips prefer well-drained, loose, and loamy soils that allow roots to expand easily. Avoid compacted or rocky soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for turnips ranges from 6.0 to 7.5, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Add compost or organic matter to the soil to improve fertility and ensure even moisture retention.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Turnips</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,turnip" alt="Fertilizer for Turnips"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting to provide essential nutrients for root growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Incorporate organic fertilizers like compost or aged manure to boost soil nutrients naturally.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> During early growth, apply a light dose of nitrogen-rich fertilizer to encourage healthy leaf development without delaying root growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?turnip,disease" alt="Diseases in Turnips"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease causing yellow spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and ensure good air circulation to prevent infection.</li>
                <li><strong>Clubroot:</strong> A soil-borne disease causing swollen roots. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Practice crop rotation and maintain proper pH levels in the soil to prevent this disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Maggots:</strong> Insect larvae that damage the roots. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use row covers and crop rotation to minimize maggot infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?turnip,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Avoid planting turnips in the same spot year after year to prevent soil-borne diseases like clubroot.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Maintain a weed-free field, especially during the early growth stages, to avoid competition for nutrients and sunlight.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and diseased material from the field to prevent the spread of pathogens.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Use drip irrigation or water at the base of the plants to reduce moisture on leaves and prevent fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Choose turnip varieties that are resistant to common diseases like downy mildew and clubroot.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?turnip,care" alt="Care for Turnips"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Turnips prefer cooler temperatures, between 50-75°F (10-24°C). Plant in early spring or fall for the best results.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Turnips require consistent moisture to develop large, tender roots. Water deeply and regularly to keep the soil evenly moist.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space turnip plants 6-8 inches apart in rows 12-18 inches apart to allow sufficient room for root development.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like flea beetles and root maggots. Use organic pest control methods or integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to reduce infestations.</li>
