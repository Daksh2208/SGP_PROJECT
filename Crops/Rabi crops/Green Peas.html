            <img src="greenpeas-field.jpeg" alt="Green Peas Planting">
            <p>Green peas thrive in cool weather and can be planted in various seasons depending on the climate. The best seasons for growing green peas are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plant peas in early spring as soon as the soil can be worked (March to April).</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> In milder climates, peas can also be sown in late summer (July to August) for a fall harvest.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Green peas prefer well-drained, loamy soil that is rich in organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for green peas is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting to provide essential nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost or well-rotted manure to enhance soil fertility and promote healthy growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Side-dress with nitrogen-rich fertilizers during the growing season for improved yield.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease causing white powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve air circulation and use fungicides as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Caused by overwatering, leading to wilting and plant death. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Pea Weevil:</strong> A pest that can damage seeds and pods. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use traps or insecticides for effective management.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate peas with non-legume crops to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Regularly remove weeds to reduce competition for nutrients and moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Keep the planting area clean by removing debris and dead plants to prevent disease outbreaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Water at the base of the plants and avoid wetting the foliage to minimize disease risk.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Green peas grow best in temperatures between 55-70°F (13-21°C) and are frost-sensitive.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Peas require consistent moisture, especially during flowering and pod development.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space pea plants about 2-4 inches apart in rows that are 18-24 inches apart for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids and cutworms. Employ organic pest control methods as needed.</li>
