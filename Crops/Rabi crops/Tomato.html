            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Tomatoes</h2>
            <img src="Tomato.webp" alt="Tomato Field">
            <p>Tomatoes are warm-season crops that thrive in sunny, frost-free conditions. The best seasons for growing tomatoes are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plant tomatoes in early spring (March to April) after the last frost when temperatures are consistently above 50°F (10°C).</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> In cooler climates, tomatoes can also be planted in early summer for a continuous harvest.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,tomato" alt="Soil for Tomatoes"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Tomatoes grow best in well-drained, loamy soils rich in organic matter. Ensure the soil has good moisture retention but is not waterlogged.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for tomatoes is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost or well-rotted manure before planting to enhance fertility and moisture retention.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Tomatoes</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,tomato" alt="Fertilizer for Tomatoes"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer (5-10-10) during planting to promote strong root growth and fruit development.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost or organic fertilizers such as fish emulsion or bone meal for sustained nutrient supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Apply a nitrogen-rich fertilizer during the early growth stages, followed by a potassium-rich fertilizer during flowering and fruiting stages.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?tomato,disease" alt="Diseases in Tomatoes"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blight:</strong> A fungal disease causing leaf spots and fruit rot. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides, practice crop rotation, and ensure proper plant spacing for air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Tomato Mosaic Virus:</strong> Causes mottled leaves and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove infected plants and use resistant varieties to prevent spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Fusarium Wilt:</strong> A soil-borne fungus causing wilting and yellowing of plants. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Practice crop rotation and use resistant tomato varieties.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?tomato,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Avoid planting tomatoes in the same spot year after year to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field weed-free, especially during the early growth stages, to reduce competition for nutrients and sunlight.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and diseased material to prevent disease spread in the field.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Use drip irrigation or water at the base of the plants to avoid wetting the foliage and reducing fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant disease-resistant tomato varieties to reduce the risk of common diseases like blight and mosaic virus.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?tomato,care" alt="Care for Tomatoes"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Tomatoes grow best in temperatures between 70-85°F (21-29°C). Avoid planting in areas prone to frost or temperatures below 50°F (10°C).</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Tomatoes require consistent moisture, especially during fruiting. Water deeply and regularly, but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space tomato plants 18-24 inches apart in rows 3-4 feet apart to ensure good air circulation and prevent disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like aphids, whiteflies, and tomato hornworms. Use organic or integrated pest management (IPM) techniques to control infestations.</li>
