            <img src="Radish.jpg" alt="Radish Planting">
            <p>Radish is a cool-season vegetable, ideal for rapid growth. The best seasons for growing radish are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Sow radish seeds in early spring (March to May) when the soil is workable and temperatures are cool.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> In cooler climates, radish can also be planted in late summer (August to September) for a fall harvest.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,radish" alt="Soil for Radish"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Radish grows best in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils that are rich in organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for radish is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure into the soil to improve fertility and moisture retention.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,radish" alt="Fertilizer for Radish"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting to provide essential nutrients for strong growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost or well-rotted manure to promote healthy soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Lightly fertilize with a nitrogen-based fertilizer during early growth to enhance leaf development.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clubroot:</strong> A soil-borne disease causing swollen, deformed roots. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Rotate crops and avoid planting radish in areas with a history of clubroot.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease causing yellow spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and ensure good air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Black Rot:</strong> Bacterial disease causing dark lesions on leaves and roots. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use clean seeds and avoid overwatering.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate radish with non-cruciferous crops to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field free of weeds to minimize competition and the spread of diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove diseased plant debris from the field to prevent the spread of pathogens.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid overwatering to prevent root diseases and ensure good drainage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?radish,care" alt="Care for Radish"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Radish grows best in cool temperatures between 50-70°F (10-21°C).</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist, but avoid waterlogging, especially during the root development phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space radish plants about 2-3 inches apart in rows that are 12-18 inches apart to allow room for root growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like flea beetles and root maggots. Use organic pest control methods as needed.</li>
