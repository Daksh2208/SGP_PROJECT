            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Wheat</h2>
            <img src="wheat-field.jpeg" alt="Wheat Field">
            <p>Wheat is primarily grown during cooler seasons. The planting season varies based on the variety:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Winter Wheat:</strong> Planted in the fall (September to November) and harvested in late spring or early summer (June to July).</li>
                <li><strong>Spring Wheat:</strong> Planted in early spring (March to April) and harvested in late summer or early fall (August to September).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Wheat thrives in well-drained, loamy soils that are rich in nutrients. Avoid waterlogged soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for wheat is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter, such as compost or well-rotted manure, to enhance soil fertility.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="fertilizer">
            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Wheat</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Fertilizers:</strong> Apply nitrogen fertilizers (like urea) to support vegetative growth and enhance yields.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Use balanced fertilizers to promote root development and overall plant health.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Apply additional nitrogen during the tillering stage to maximize grain production.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="diseases">
            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Wheat</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaf Rust:</strong> A fungal disease causing reddish-orange pustules on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and fungicides as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungal infection with white powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure good air circulation and apply fungicides when necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Fusarium Head Blight:</strong> Affects wheat heads and reduces grain quality. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Avoid planting in overly wet conditions and apply fungicides if needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultural-practices">
            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate wheat with legumes or non-cereal crops to break disease cycles.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove infected plant debris to reduce disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep fields free of weeds to prevent harboring pests and diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Water adequately but avoid over-irrigation to prevent fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Choose disease-resistant wheat varieties to minimize risk of diseases.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Wheat grows best in temperatures between 55째F and 75째F (12째C to 24째C). Avoid planting during extreme heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Wheat requires consistent moisture, especially during the boot and grain-filling stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space wheat plants 6-8 inches apart with rows 6-12 inches apart for proper air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids and use integrated pest management techniques to control infestations.</li>
