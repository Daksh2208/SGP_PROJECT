            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Chickpeas</h2>
            <img src="Chickpea.jpg" alt="Chickpea Planting">
            <p>Chickpeas are a cool-season crop that grows best in temperate conditions. They are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soils. The best seasons for growing chickpeas are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Winter:</strong> In regions with mild winters, chickpeas can be sown in late fall or early winter for a spring harvest (October to February).</li>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> In cooler climates, plant chickpeas in early spring (March to May) once the soil has warmed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,chickpea" alt="Soil for Chickpea"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Chickpeas grow best in light, well-drained soils such as sandy loam or clay loam. They are sensitive to waterlogging, so avoid poorly drained soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for chickpeas is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Add compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility, but avoid excessive nitrogen, as chickpeas fix their own nitrogen from the atmosphere.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Chickpeas</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,chickpea" alt="Fertilizer for Chickpea"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium Fertilizers:</strong> Use fertilizers that are rich in phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) to encourage root development and seed formation. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers.</li>
                <li><strong>Rhizobium Inoculants:</strong> Inoculate seeds with Rhizobium bacteria before planting to promote nitrogen fixation and improve soil fertility naturally.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Incorporate compost or organic matter into the soil to maintain fertility and improve water retention.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Chickpeas</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?chickpea,disease" alt="Diseases in Chickpeas"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ascochyta Blight:</strong> A fungal disease that causes leaf spots, stem lesions, and seed discoloration. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties, rotate crops, and apply fungicides when necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Fusarium Wilt:</strong> A soil-borne disease that causes wilting and yellowing of plants. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Plant resistant varieties and practice crop rotation to minimize the spread of the disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Caused by waterlogged soils, root rot leads to poor plant growth and decay of roots. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper soil drainage and avoid overwatering.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?chickpea,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate chickpeas with cereals or other non-legume crops to break the cycle of soil-borne diseases and pests.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field free of weeds to prevent competition for nutrients, especially during the early growth stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce the risk of disease buildup in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Use drip irrigation or water at the base of the plants to avoid excessive moisture on foliage, reducing the risk of fungal diseases.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?chickpea,care" alt="Care for Chickpea"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Chickpeas grow best in temperatures between 50-85°F (10-30°C). They can tolerate cool weather but are sensitive to frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Chickpeas require minimal water once established. Avoid overwatering, especially during flowering and seed development.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space chickpea plants 6-8 inches apart in rows that are 18-24 inches apart to allow for proper air circulation and root growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids, cutworms, and pod borers. Use organic pest control methods like neem oil or row covers to protect plants.</li>
