            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Upland Cress</h2>
            <img src="Upland Cress.jpg" alt="Upland Cress Field">
            <p>Upland cress is a cool-season crop that grows best in mild weather. It can be grown in both spring and fall for optimal results. The best seasons for growing upland cress are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plant upland cress in early spring (March to May) when temperatures are cool and moderate.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Upland cress can be sown in late summer or early fall (August to October) for a fall harvest.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,upland-cress" alt="Soil for Upland Cress"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Upland cress thrives in rich, well-drained soils with good moisture retention. Loamy or sandy soils work best.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for upland cress is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Add compost or organic matter to improve soil fertility and ensure adequate moisture for the plants.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,upland-cress" alt="Fertilizer for Upland Cress"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting to provide essential nutrients for healthy leaf growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure to naturally enhance soil fertility and moisture retention.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Apply a light application of nitrogen-rich fertilizer during the growing season to encourage leafy growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?upland-cress,disease" alt="Diseases in Upland Cress"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that causes yellowing and wilting of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and avoid overhead watering to reduce infection risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Fungal spots that form on leaves, reducing yield. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties and rotate crops to minimize spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Small insects that can damage leaves by sucking sap. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticidal soaps or beneficial insects to control aphid infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?upland-cress,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate upland cress with other non-brassica crops to prevent soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field weed-free to reduce competition for nutrients and sunlight, especially during the early growth stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and diseased material to prevent the spread of pathogens.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Use drip irrigation to avoid wetting the leaves and reduce fungal infections like downy mildew.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Select disease-resistant upland cress varieties to lower the risk of infections.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?upland-cress,care" alt="Care for Upland Cress"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Upland cress grows best in temperatures between 45-75°F (7-24°C). Avoid planting during extreme heat to prevent bolting.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Upland cress needs consistent moisture. Water regularly to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space upland cress plants 6-8 inches apart in rows 12-18 inches apart to allow proper air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like flea beetles and aphids. Use organic pest control methods to minimize infestations.</li>
