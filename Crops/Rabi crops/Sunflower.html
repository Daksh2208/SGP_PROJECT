            <img src="Sunflower.webp" alt="Sunflower Field">
            <p>Sunflowers thrive in warm, sunny conditions. The best seasons for growing sunflowers are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Sunflowers are typically planted in early to mid-spring (March to May) when soil temperatures are above 50째F (10째C).</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> In temperate regions, sunflower planting can extend into early summer (June to July).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,sunflower" alt="Soil for Sunflowers"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Sunflowers prefer well-drained loamy or sandy soil but can adapt to a variety of soil types. Avoid waterlogged soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for sunflowers is between 6.0 and 7.5, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter such as compost to improve soil structure and fertility before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Sunflowers</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,sunflower" alt="Fertilizer for Sunflowers"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer (15-15-15) at planting to provide essential nutrients for growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost or well-rotted manure to boost soil fertility naturally.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> During flowering, apply nitrogen-rich fertilizers to support strong stalk and flower development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Sunflowers</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?sunflower,disease" alt="Diseases in Sunflowers"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease causing white mold on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicide treatments and rotate crops to avoid infected soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Rust:</strong> Causes reddish-brown spots on leaves, reducing photosynthesis. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply appropriate fungicides and ensure proper plant spacing for air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Verticillium Wilt:</strong> A soil-borne fungus causing wilting and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Practice crop rotation and avoid planting sunflowers in affected fields.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?sunflower,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate sunflowers with non-host crops to minimize soil-borne diseases like wilt and mildew.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field free of weeds during early growth stages to reduce competition for sunlight and nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and infected material to prevent disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Use drip irrigation and avoid wetting the foliage to reduce fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant sunflower varieties resistant to common diseases like rust and mildew.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?sunflower,care" alt="Care for Sunflowers"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Sunflowers grow best in temperatures between 70-78째F (21-25째C). They are heat-tolerant but do not perform well in frost conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Sunflowers are drought-tolerant but require consistent moisture during the growing season, especially when heads are forming.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space sunflower plants 12-18 inches apart in rows that are 24-36 inches apart for proper air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and sunflower moths. Use organic pest control methods or integrated pest management (IPM) strategies.</li>
