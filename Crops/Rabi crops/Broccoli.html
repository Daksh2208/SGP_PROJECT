            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Broccoli</h2>
            <img src="broccoli-field.jpeg" alt="Broccoli Planting">
            <p>Broccoli is a cool-season crop that thrives in temperatures between 65-75째F (18-24째C). It prefers mild conditions for optimal growth. The best seasons for growing broccoli are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plant broccoli in early spring (March to April) for a late spring to early summer harvest. Start seeds indoors or directly sow outdoors after the last frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Broccoli can also be planted in late summer (July to August) for a fall harvest. This allows the crop to mature as the weather cools.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,broccoli" alt="Soil for Broccoli"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Broccoli grows best in well-drained, fertile loamy soils. It prefers soil that is rich in organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for broccoli ranges between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Add compost or well-rotted manure to enrich the soil before planting, ensuring proper moisture retention and nutrient availability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Broccoli</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,broccoli" alt="Fertilizer for Broccoli"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> A balanced fertilizer (such as 10-10-10) at planting provides essential nutrients for strong foliage and head development.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Compost or aged manure can enhance soil fertility, improving plant growth and yield.</li>
                <li><strong>Side Dressing:</strong> Apply a nitrogen-rich fertilizer when the plants are about halfway to maturity to promote bigger broccoli heads.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Broccoli</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?broccoli,disease" alt="Diseases in Broccoli"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease causing yellow spots on leaves with white mold underneath. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and avoid overhead watering to manage the disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Clubroot:</strong> A soil-borne disease that causes swollen, distorted roots, leading to stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Rotate crops and use resistant varieties.</li>
                <li><strong>Black Rot:</strong> Bacterial infection that causes V-shaped lesions on leaf edges. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Plant resistant varieties and practice crop rotation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?broccoli,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate broccoli with non-brassica crops (such as legumes or grains) to prevent disease buildup in the soil.</                </li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris after harvest and avoid planting broccoli in the same area for consecutive years to reduce the spread of soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space broccoli plants at least 18-24 inches apart to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity, which helps prevent fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Water at the base of the plant rather than from overhead to avoid wetting the foliage, reducing the risk of fungal diseases like downy mildew.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?broccoli,care" alt="Care for Broccoli"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Broccoli grows best in cool temperatures between 65-75째F (18-24째C). Protect plants from extreme heat, which can cause bolting (premature flowering).</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Broccoli requires consistent moisture, particularly during head formation. Water regularly to keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space broccoli plants 18-24 inches apart, with rows spaced about 2-3 feet apart to allow room for growth and proper air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like cabbage worms, aphids, and flea beetles. Use row covers or organic insecticides, and practice integrated pest management (IPM) for pest control.</li>
