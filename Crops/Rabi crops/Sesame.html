            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Sesame</h2>
            <img src="sesame-field.jpeg" alt="Sesame Field">
            <p>Sesame is a warm-season crop that thrives in hot, dry conditions. The best seasons for growing sesame are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> In tropical and subtropical regions, sesame is planted in late spring (April to June) after the last frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> In temperate regions, sesame is planted in early summer (June to July).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,sesame" alt="Soil for Sesame"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Sesame thrives in well-drained, sandy loam or light-textured soils. It is drought-tolerant but sensitive to waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for sesame ranges from 5.5 to 7.5, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Plow the soil deeply to loosen it and incorporate organic matter like compost for better moisture retention.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Sesame</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,sesame" alt="Fertilizer for Sesame"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer (20-10-10) at planting to support root and stem development.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use well-rotted manure or compost to improve soil structure and fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Apply a nitrogen-rich fertilizer during the flowering stage to enhance yield and seed quality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Sesame</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?sesame,disease" alt="Diseases in Sesame"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> A fungal disease causing brown spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and plant disease-resistant varieties.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> A soil-borne disease that causes root decay, especially in poorly drained soils. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper soil drainage and avoid waterlogged conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Wilt Disease:</strong> A fungal disease that causes plants to wilt and die prematurely. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Rotate crops and use disease-free seeds.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?sesame,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate sesame with non-susceptible crops to minimize soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field weed-free during the early growth stages to reduce competition for nutrients and water.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and diseased plants from the field to reduce pest and disease buildup.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Use drip irrigation to maintain consistent moisture and avoid waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant sesame varieties resistant to common diseases like leaf spot and wilt disease.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?sesame,care" alt="Care for Sesame"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Sesame grows best in temperatures between 77-86°F (25-30°C). It cannot tolerate frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Sesame is drought-tolerant but requires consistent moisture during flowering and seed setting stages. Avoid overwatering.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space sesame plants 12-18 inches apart in rows that are 24-36 inches apart for proper air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like aphids and whiteflies. Use organic pesticides or integrated pest management (IPM) methods as needed.</li>
