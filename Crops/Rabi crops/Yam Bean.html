            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tropical Regions:</strong> Planted during the rainy season (April to June) and harvested after 4 to 6 months.</li>
                <li><strong>Subtropical Regions:</strong> Planted in spring (March to April) and harvested in late summer (August to September).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Yam Bean thrives in sandy loam soils that are well-drained and rich in organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for yam bean is between 5.5 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Add compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil structure and fertility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Yam Bean</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Fertilizers:</strong> Apply nitrogen fertilizers to support healthy vegetative growth, especially in the early stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> These nutrients promote tuber development and overall plant health.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Apply additional nitrogen at the vegetative growth stage for enhanced tuber yield.</li>
