            <p>Fennel is a flavorful herb that prefers cooler weather. The best seasons for growing fennel are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plant fennel seeds in early spring (March to April) for a summer harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> In warmer climates, fennel can be sown in late summer (July to August) for a fall harvest.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Fennel prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soil enriched with organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for fennel is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure into the soil before planting to enhance fertility.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting to support healthy growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost or organic fertilizers like fish emulsion to promote strong development.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Side-dress with nitrogen-rich fertilizers during the growing season to encourage leafy growth.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Fennel thrives in temperatures between 60-75°F (15-24°C) and is sensitive to frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Fennel requires consistent moisture, particularly during dry spells. Keep the soil evenly moist.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space fennel plants about 12-18 inches apart to allow for proper air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic pest control methods as needed.</li>
