            <p>Fenugreek is a versatile herb that prefers warm conditions. The best seasons for growing fenugreek are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plant fenugreek seeds in early spring (March to April) for a summer harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> In warmer climates, you can sow seeds in late summer (August to September) for a fall harvest.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Fenugreek prefers well-drained, sandy to loamy soil rich in organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for fenugreek is between 6.0 and 7.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting to support growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost or well-rotted manure to enrich the soil and enhance plant health.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Side-dress with nitrogen-rich fertilizers during the growing season to promote leaf growth.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that appears as white powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve air circulation and avoid overhead watering. Use fungicides if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Caused by overwatering or poorly drained soils, leading to wilting and plant death. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Small pests that suck sap from the plants, leading to stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticidal soap or neem oil for effective management.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate fenugreek with other crops to prevent soil-borne diseases and pest buildup.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Regularly remove weeds to reduce competition and pest habitats.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Keep the planting area clean by removing debris and dead plants to prevent disease outbreaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Water at the base of the plants and avoid wetting the foliage to minimize disease risk.</li>
