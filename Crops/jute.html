            <h2>1. What is Jute?</h2>
            <p>Jute is a long, soft, and shiny vegetable fiber that can be spun into coarse, strong threads. It is one of the most affordable natural fibers and is widely used in the production of textiles like burlap, hessian, and sacks. Jute comes primarily from the plants *Corchorus olitorius* and *Corchorus capsularis*.</p>

        <div class="section" id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of Jute</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Jute fibers are typically off-white to brown in color and 1-4 meters long. Jute plants are tall and thin, with light green leaves and yellow flowers.</li>
                <li><strong>Types:</strong> The two main types of jute are white jute (*Corchorus capsularis*) and tossa jute (*Corchorus olitorius*), with tossa jute being more valued for its quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Uses:</strong> Jute is primarily used in the production of coarse fabrics such as sacks, ropes, carpets, and as a biodegradable alternative to plastic packaging. It is also used in making textiles and eco-friendly products.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Jute</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Jute thrives in warm, humid climates with temperatures between 68°F and 100°F (20°C to 37°C). It requires a rainfall of about 1200 mm to 2500 mm, especially during the sowing and growing stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Jute grows best in well-drained, fertile alluvial or loamy soils. The soil should have a pH between 6.0 and 7.5, and the land should be free from waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Jute seeds are typically sown at the beginning of the monsoon season, usually between March and May. They are sown directly in the field in rows, spaced about 25-30 cm apart. Proper weeding and thinning are essential during the early stages.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Jute</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Jute requires consistent moisture, particularly during its early growth stages. It is largely rain-fed, but supplementary irrigation may be needed if rainfall is insufficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Jute benefits from organic fertilizers such as compost or manure. Balanced use of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) fertilizers boosts plant growth and fiber quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Common pests that affect jute include stem weevils, jute hairy caterpillars, and aphids. Integrated pest management (IPM) using biological controls and safe pesticides helps protect the crop.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Jute is susceptible to diseases like stem rot and anthracnose. Use resistant varieties, proper spacing, and fungicides to minimize disease outbreaks. Crop rotation can also prevent disease build-up.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Jute</h2>
            <p>Jute is typically harvested when the plants reach a height of about 10-12 feet, usually 4-5 months after planting. Harvesting is done before the plants start flowering to ensure high fiber quality. The plants are cut close to the ground, tied into bundles, and soaked in water for retting—a process where the stalks are submerged in water to soften and separate the fibers. After retting, the fibers are stripped from the stalks, washed, and dried.</p>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Jute</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Textile:</strong> Jute is used to produce a wide range of fabrics, including hessian, burlap, and gunny sacks. It is a versatile fiber for industrial and packaging purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Jute is used as an eco-friendly, biodegradable material for agricultural purposes, such as mulching and soil conservation.</li>
                <li><strong>Eco-friendly Products:</strong> Jute is increasingly being used in the production of biodegradable alternatives to plastic bags, home decor, and eco-friendly fashion items.</li>
