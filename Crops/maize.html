            <h2>1. What is Maize?</h2>
            <p>Maize (*Zea mays*), commonly known as corn, is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. It is a staple food in many countries and is widely used for food, animal feed, and industrial products.</p>

            <h2>2. Characteristics of Maize</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Maize plants can grow 3 to 10 feet tall with large, broad leaves. The ears grow on the sides of the plant, containing kernels encased in husks.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Fresh maize has a sweet and juicy flavor, while dried kernels have a more robust taste and can be used for various dishes.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Maize is a good source of carbohydrates, dietary fiber, vitamins (especially B vitamins), and minerals such as magnesium and phosphorus.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Maize</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Maize thrives in warm climates with temperatures between 60°F and 95°F (15°C to 35°C). It requires full sunlight and a frost-free growing season.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Maize prefers well-drained, fertile soils rich in organic matter. The ideal soil pH is between 5.8 and 7.0.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Maize is typically planted in the spring, once the soil temperature reaches at least 50°F (10°C). Seeds should be planted 1-2 inches deep, spaced 6-12 inches apart.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Maize</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Maize requires regular watering, especially during the flowering and grain-filling stages. Aim for 1-1.5 inches of water per week.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium at planting and during key growth stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Common pests include corn borers and rootworms. Integrated pest management strategies and organic pesticides can be effective in controlling these pests.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Maize can be affected by fungal diseases such as rust and blight. Crop rotation and resistant varieties can help manage these issues.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Maize</h2>
            <p>Maize is ready for harvest when the husks turn brown and the kernels are hard. This typically occurs 60-100 days after planting, depending on the variety. Harvest by cutting the ears from the stalks and allowing them to dry before storage.</p>
        </div>
