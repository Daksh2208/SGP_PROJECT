            <h2>1. What are Beans?</h2>
            <p>Beans are legumes that belong to the Fabaceae family. They are grown for their edible seeds, which are a staple in many cuisines around the world due to their high protein content and nutritional benefits.</p>

        <div class="section" id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of Beans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Bean plants can be bushy or climbing, and the seeds (beans) come in a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes depending on the species.</li>
                <li><strong>Varieties:</strong> Common beans include kidney beans, black beans, pinto beans, and navy beans, each with distinct uses and nutritional profiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Beans are rich in protein, fiber, vitamins B and C, and minerals like iron, magnesium, and potassium.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Beans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Beans thrive in warm, temperate climates with temperatures between 65째F and 85째F (18째C to 29째C). Frost can severely damage bean crops.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Beans prefer well-drained, sandy loam soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.5. Adding organic matter to the soil enhances growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow seeds directly in the garden after the last frost, spacing them 1-2 inches apart in rows. Pole beans require trellising, while bush beans do not.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Beans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Beans require consistent moisture, especially during flowering and pod development. Water at the base of the plant to avoid wetting the leaves, which can lead to fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Beans are nitrogen-fixing plants, so they require minimal fertilization. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush foliage but fewer pods.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like aphids, bean beetles, and root rot. Use organic pest management techniques and rotate crops to minimize pest and disease issues.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Beans</h2>
            <p>Beans can be harvested at different stages depending on their intended use. Snap beans (green beans) are harvested when the pods are tender, while dry beans are harvested when the pods are mature and dry. Use a sharp tool to cut the pods from the plant to avoid damaging the vines.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Beans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Culinary:</strong> Beans are versatile and can be used in soups, stews, salads, and side dishes. They are a staple protein source in vegetarian and vegan diets.</li>
                <li><strong>Preservation:</strong> Beans can be dried, canned, or frozen for long-term storage, making them a great pantry staple.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Beans are high in fiber, which supports digestive health, and are a good source of plant-based protein. They are also heart-healthy due to their low fat and cholesterol content.</li>
