            <h2>1. What is Soybean?</h2>
            <p>Soybean (*Glycine max*) is a legume native to East Asia, widely cultivated for its edible seeds. It is a major source of protein and oil, commonly used in food products, animal feed, and industrial applications.</p>

            <h2>2. Characteristics of Soybean</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Soybean plants grow 1-4 feet tall, with trifoliate leaves and clusters of small white or purple flowers.</li>
                <li><strong>Varieties:</strong> Soybeans come in various types, including yellow, green, black, and brown, each with different uses.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Rich in protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, soybeans are beneficial for human and animal health.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Cultivation of Soybean</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Soybeans thrive in warm climates, with optimal temperatures between 70째F and 95째F (21째C to 35째C).</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> They prefer well-drained, loamy soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0 and good organic matter content.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow seeds 1-2 inches deep, spacing them 1-2 inches apart in rows 30 inches apart. Ideal planting time is in spring after the last frost.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Soybean</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Ensure consistent moisture, especially during flowering and pod development. Avoid waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Soybeans can fix nitrogen in the soil, but applying phosphorus and potassium based on soil tests can enhance growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like soybean aphids and spider mites. Use integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to control infestations.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Soybeans are susceptible to diseases such as root rot and leaf spot. Crop rotation and resistant varieties can help mitigate these issues.</li>
            </ul>
