            <h2>1. What is Coffee?</h2>
            <p>Coffee is a brewed beverage made from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. Coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide, and its production is a major agricultural industry in tropical regions.</p>

        <div class="section" id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of Coffee</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Coffee plants are small evergreen shrubs that produce clusters of white flowers and red or purple berries (called coffee cherries). Each cherry contains two seeds, or beans.</li>
                <li><strong>Varieties:</strong> The two main varieties are *Coffea arabica* (Arabica) and *Coffea canephora* (Robusta). Arabica beans are known for their smooth flavor, while Robusta beans are stronger and more bitter.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Coffee beans are rich in antioxidants, particularly polyphenols. The caffeine in coffee acts as a stimulant, enhancing mental alertness and performance.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Coffee</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Coffee grows best in tropical climates, typically at high altitudes between 2,000 and 6,000 feet. It thrives in temperatures between 60°F and 70°F (15°C to 24°C) and requires moderate rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Coffee prefers well-drained, fertile soils rich in organic matter. A slightly acidic pH of 6.0 to 6.5 is ideal. Mulching and organic fertilizers help improve soil health and productivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Coffee seeds or seedlings should be planted during the rainy season. Space the plants about 2-3 meters apart. Shade trees are often planted alongside coffee to protect the plants from excessive sunlight and improve soil fertility.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Coffee</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Coffee requires consistent moisture, especially during flowering and fruiting stages. However, waterlogged soil should be avoided as it can lead to root diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Use balanced fertilizers that include nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Regularly adding organic matter, such as compost or manure, improves soil fertility and promotes healthy growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Coffee plants are susceptible to pests such as coffee berry borers, leaf miners, and aphids. Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, including biological controls and careful pesticide use, are essential for managing these pests.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Common coffee diseases include coffee leaf rust and coffee berry disease. Preventive measures such as proper pruning, maintaining field hygiene, and applying organic fungicides can reduce disease risk.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Coffee</h2>
            <p>Coffee cherries are ready for harvesting when they turn bright red, usually 6-9 months after flowering. Harvesting is typically done by hand, either by selectively picking ripe cherries or strip-picking the entire branch. After harvesting, the beans are processed by either the dry or wet method before being dried, sorted, and roasted.</p>

            <h2>6. Uses of Coffee</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Culinary:</strong> Coffee beans are roasted and ground to make coffee, a beverage enjoyed hot or cold worldwide. It is also used in various desserts, chocolates, and savory dishes.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial:</strong> Coffee grounds are used in cosmetic products, scrubs, and even as organic fertilizers due to their nutrient-rich content.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Coffee has been associated with several health benefits, including improved brain function, a reduced risk of certain diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, and better metabolism. Its high antioxidant content helps fight free radicals in the body.</li>
