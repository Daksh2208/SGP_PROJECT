            <h2>1. What is Sugarcane?</h2>
            <p>Sugarcane (*Saccharum officinarum*) is a tropical grass cultivated for its high sugar content. It is a primary source of sugar, molasses, and biofuel, playing a vital role in the agricultural economy.</p>

        <div class="section" id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of Sugarcane</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Sugarcane is tall and jointed, growing up to 10-20 feet tall, with long green stalks.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The stalks are sweet, containing high levels of sucrose.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Sugarcane is low in calories but provides carbohydrates and essential minerals like calcium and magnesium.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Sugarcane</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Sugarcane thrives in warm, tropical climates, requiring temperatures between 68°F and 95°F (20°C to 35°C).</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Prefers well-drained, fertile soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.5.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Plant sugarcane stalks (setts) in furrows, ensuring good contact with the soil. Planting is best done in the spring or early summer.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Sugarcane</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Requires consistent moisture, especially during the growing season. Irrigation may be needed during dry periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium based on soil tests to enhance growth and sugar content.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like cane borers and aphids. Use integrated pest management (IPM) techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Common diseases include sugarcane mosaic and red rot. Rotate crops and use disease-resistant varieties to minimize risks.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Sugarcane</h2>
            <p>Harvest sugarcane when the stalks reach maturity, usually 10-12 months after planting. Cut the stalks close to the ground using a machete or harvester. It’s best to harvest before the first frost for optimal sugar content.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Sugarcane</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Culinary:</strong> Sugarcane is processed into sugar, molasses, and syrup for culinary uses.</li>
                <li><strong>Biofuel:</strong> Sugarcane is used to produce ethanol and other biofuels.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial:</strong> Sugarcane by-products are used in paper, textiles, and biodegradable plastics.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Sugarcane juice is a refreshing drink and is considered to have various health benefits, including hydration and energy replenishment.</li>
