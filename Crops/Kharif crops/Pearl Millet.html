            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Pearl Millet</h2>
            <img src="Pearl Millet.avif" alt="Pearl Millet Planting">
            <p>Pearl millet, also known as bajra, is a drought-resistant cereal crop suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The best seasons for growing pearl millet are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kharif Season:</strong> Pearl millet is primarily sown during the kharif season (June to July) and harvested in September to October, taking advantage of the monsoon rains.</li>
                <li><strong>Rabi Season:</strong> In some regions, pearl millet can also be grown in the rabi season (October to December) and harvested in February to March.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,pearl-millet" alt="Soil for Pearl Millet"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Pearl millet thrives in well-drained sandy loam, loamy, or clayey soils. It can tolerate poor and dry soils but prefers fertile fields.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for pearl millet ranges from 5.5 to 7.5. It can adapt to slightly acidic to neutral soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Prepare the soil by plowing and mixing organic matter like compost to enhance fertility and soil structure before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Pearl Millet</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,pearl-millet" alt="Fertilizer for Pearl Millet"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Incorporate well-rotted farmyard manure or compost during land preparation to improve soil health.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Fertilizers:</strong> Apply nitrogenous fertilizers such as urea or ammonium nitrate during the early stages of growth to promote vegetative development.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Use phosphorus (superphosphate) and potassium (muriate of potash) at the time of planting to support root development and overall plant health.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Pearl Millet</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?pearl-millet,disease" alt="Diseases in Pearl Millet"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that affects the leaves, leading to stunted growth and reduced yield. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and apply fungicides if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Rust:</strong> A fungal disease causing reddish-brown pustules on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure good air circulation, practice crop rotation, and use fungicides for severe outbreaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Grain Midge:</strong> An insect pest that damages developing grains. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticides and cultural practices like maintaining field hygiene to manage midge populations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?pearl-millet,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate pearl millet with legumes or other cereals to break disease cycles and improve soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Manage weeds effectively to reduce competition for nutrients and moisture, especially during the early growth stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to minimize disease incidence in the following crop cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> While pearl millet is drought-tolerant, ensure adequate moisture during critical growth stages, particularly during germination and flowering.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties of pearl millet to reduce susceptibility to common diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?pearl-millet,care" alt="Care for Pearl Millet"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Pearl millet thrives in warm temperatures ranging from 77-95°F (25-35°C). It is highly tolerant to heat and drought conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> While it is drought-resistant, consistent moisture is essential during germination and early growth. Provide irrigation in dry spells if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 12-15 inches apart to allow adequate airflow and reduce competition for nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like grain midges and aphids. Use integrated pest management (IPM) practices, including cultural, mechanical, and biological controls.</li>
