            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Chilli</h2>
            <img src="Chillli.jpg" alt="Chilli Planting">
            <p>Chillies thrive in warm climates and can be grown during various seasons. The best seasons for growing chillies are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Chillies are generally sown in early summer for optimal growth and yield.</li>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> In tropical regions, chillies can be planted just before or during the monsoon season for rain-fed cultivation.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In areas with milder winters, chillies can be grown post-monsoon under irrigated conditions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,chilli" alt="Soil for Chilli"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Chillies grow well in well-drained loamy or sandy loam soils. They can tolerate light, sandy soils as well, provided they are rich in organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for chilli is between 6.0 and 7.0. Avoid highly acidic or alkaline soils for better growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Plow the soil thoroughly and incorporate organic matter like compost or well-decomposed manure to enhance fertility.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,chilli" alt="Fertilizer for Chilli"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced NPK fertilizer, such as 10-20-10, to meet the nutrient needs of chilli plants, especially during early growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost to enrich the soil with organic nutrients and improve water retention.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> During the flowering and fruiting stages, apply nitrogen-rich fertilizers like urea to boost plant vigor and fruit production.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?chilli,disease" alt="Diseases in Chilli"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anthracnose:</strong> A fungal disease that causes dark spots on fruits. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and resistant varieties to manage this disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> Causes white, powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and ensure good air circulation between plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Wilt:</strong> Affects the roots and causes plant wilting. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use disease-free seeds and crop rotation to prevent this disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids and Thrips:</strong> Common pests that attack chilli plants. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use neem-based insecticides or chemical sprays to manage infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?chilli,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate chilli with non-host crops to reduce soil-borne diseases and pests.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Provide adequate spacing between plants (18-24 inches) to ensure proper airflow and reduce fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant parts to prevent the spread of diseases in the field.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid waterlogging, as excess moisture can lead to root rot and other fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant disease-resistant chilli varieties for better protection against common diseases and pests.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Chillies grow best in warm temperatures ranging from 77-86°F (25-30°C) and require plenty of sunlight.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Chillies need moderate watering. Ensure the soil remains moist but not waterlogged during the growing and flowering stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space chilli plants 18-24 inches apart to allow ample room for growth and air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like aphids, whiteflies, and mites. Use organic or chemical insecticides as needed for control.</li>
