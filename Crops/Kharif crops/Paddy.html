            <img src="paddy-field.jpeg" alt="Paddy Planting">
            <p>Paddy, or rice, is grown mainly in tropical and subtropical regions with warm temperatures and abundant water. The main growing seasons for paddy are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kharif Season:</strong> Paddy is typically sown in the monsoon season (June-July) and harvested in October-November. This is the primary rice-growing season in India and many other regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Rabi Season:</strong> In some areas, paddy is also grown in the winter season (November-December) and harvested in March-April.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer Season:</strong> In some irrigated regions, paddy can be grown during the summer season, sown in February-March and harvested in June-July.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,paddy" alt="Soil for Paddy"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Paddy thrives in alluvial, clayey loam, or loamy soils that can retain water. The soil should be fertile and have good water-holding capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for paddy is between 5.5 and 6.5, slightly acidic. However, paddy can tolerate a wide range of pH levels from 4.0 to 8.0.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Paddy fields are traditionally prepared through plowing and puddling to maintain soil moisture and ensure good seedbed conditions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Paddy</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,paddy" alt="Fertilizer for Paddy"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use farmyard manure or compost to improve soil organic matter and fertility during field preparation.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Fertilizers:</strong> Apply nitrogen fertilizers like urea or ammonium sulfate during the early stages of plant growth to boost vegetative growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Use phosphorus (superphosphate) and potassium (potash) fertilizers to enhance root development and strengthen plants, particularly during transplanting.</li>
                <li><strong>Split Applications:</strong> Nitrogen fertilizers should be applied in split doses â€” one at transplanting, another during tillering, and a final dose before panicle initiation.</li>
            </ul>
