            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Rice</h2>
            <img src="rice.avif" alt="Rice Planting">
            <p>Rice is a staple crop that thrives in warm, wet climates, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It is typically grown in the following seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kharif Season:</strong> Most rice is planted during the monsoon season (June-July) when water availability is at its peak.</li>
                <li><strong>Rabi Season:</strong> In areas with irrigation facilities, rice can be grown during the Rabi season (November-December) for a secondary harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> In some regions, rice is also cultivated during the summer months where water is available.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,rice" alt="Soil for Rice"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Rice thrives in clayey loam soils that can retain water, but it can also grow in sandy or silty soils with proper water management.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for rice is between 5.0 and 6.5, though it can tolerate slightly alkaline soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Plough the field thoroughly and incorporate organic matter to improve soil fertility before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Rice</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,rice" alt="Fertilizer for Rice"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use well-decomposed manure or compost to enrich the soil and promote healthy growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Fertilizers:</strong> Rice requires nitrogen for lush growth, so applying urea or ammonium sulfate is beneficial.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Zinc deficiency is common in rice fields; apply zinc sulfate to correct this.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Rice</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?rice,disease" alt="Diseases in Rice"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blast Disease:</strong> A fungal disease that causes lesions on leaves and stems. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and apply fungicides when needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Bacterial Blight:</strong> A bacterial disease that causes yellowing and wilting of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure good drainage and use disease-resistant varieties.</li>
                <li><strong>Sheath Blight:</strong> A fungal disease causing lesions on the leaf sheaths. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Practice good field sanitation and apply fungicides.</li>
                <li><strong>Rice Tungro Virus:</strong> A virus spread by leafhoppers, causing stunted growth and yellowing of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and manage vector populations with insecticides.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?rice,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate rice with non-host crops to break the disease cycle and reduce pest pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Maintain appropriate spacing between plants to ensure good air circulation and reduce the risk of fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected crop residues to prevent the spread of diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Ensure proper irrigation practices to avoid waterlogging, which can encourage disease development.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant disease-resistant rice varieties to minimize the impact of common rice pathogens.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?rice,care" alt="Care for Rice"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Rice grows best in temperatures between 77-95°F (25-35°C) and requires abundant water during its growth stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Rice fields should remain flooded during most of the growing period for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Ensure plants are spaced properly to avoid overcrowding and to allow for adequate sunlight penetration.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like stem borers and leafhoppers, and apply control measures when necessary.</li>
