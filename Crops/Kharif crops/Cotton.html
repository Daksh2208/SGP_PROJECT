            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Cotton</h2>
            <img src="Cotton.jpeg" alt="Cotton Planting">
            <p>Cotton is a tropical and subtropical crop that requires a warm climate to thrive. The seasons for cotton cultivation vary based on the region:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> In many cotton-growing regions, cotton is planted in the spring (March-April) to take advantage of the warm growing season.</li>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> In tropical climates, cotton can also be planted during the monsoon (June-July) for a fall harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Cotton can be grown in some regions during the autumn season (August-September), depending on weather conditions and water availability.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,cotton" alt="Soil for Cotton"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Cotton prefers well-drained loamy or sandy loam soil with good organic content.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for cotton is between 6.0 and 7.5. Cotton can tolerate slightly acidic to neutral soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Add organic compost or farmyard manure to improve soil fertility and structure before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Cotton</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,cotton" alt="Fertilizer for Cotton"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen-Rich Fertilizers:</strong> Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizers to promote vigorous plant growth and high yields.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Matter:</strong> Use well-rotted manure or compost to enhance soil organic content and improve moisture retention.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Cotton benefits from micronutrients like zinc, iron, and boron, which help prevent deficiencies and improve fiber quality.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cotton,disease" alt="Diseases in Cotton"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wilt:</strong> A fungal disease that leads to wilting of plants. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Plant resistant varieties and use crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Blight:</strong> Causes leaf spots and stem lesions. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply appropriate fungicides and maintain field hygiene.</li>
                <li><strong>Bollworm:</strong> A pest that damages cotton bolls and reduces yields. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use biological control methods or insecticides to manage infestations.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Affects the root system, leading to stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid waterlogging.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cotton,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate cotton with non-host crops to break disease cycles.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Ensure adequate spacing between plants to promote air circulation and prevent humidity buildup.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce the spread of diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Water at the base to prevent wetting the foliage, which can encourage fungal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant resistant cotton varieties to minimize susceptibility to pests and diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cotton,care" alt="Care for Cotton"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Cotton grows best in warm temperatures ranging from 70-100°F (21-37°C).</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water during critical growth stages like flowering and boll formation. Cotton is drought-tolerant but benefits from regular moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 24-30 inches apart to ensure proper canopy development and sunlight exposure.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids and bollworms. Use integrated pest management strategies as needed.</li>
