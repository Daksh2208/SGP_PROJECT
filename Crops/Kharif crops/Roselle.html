            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Roselle</h2>
            <img src="roselle-field.jpeg" alt="Roselle Planting">
            <p>Roselle, also known as hibiscus sabdariffa, is a tropical plant grown for its flavorful calyces and leaves. The best seasons for growing roselle are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warm Season:</strong> Roselle is typically sown in the warm season (spring to early summer) when temperatures are consistently above 60째F (15째C) and harvested in late summer to early fall.</li>
                <li><strong>Monsoon Season:</strong> In regions with monsoon climates, roselle can be planted at the beginning of the rainy season for optimal growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,roselle" alt="Soil for Roselle"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Roselle thrives in well-drained sandy loam or loamy soils. It prefers fertile soils rich in organic matter for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for roselle ranges from 6.0 to 7.5. It can tolerate slightly acidic to neutral soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Prepare the soil by plowing and mixing organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure to enhance soil fertility and structure before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Roselle</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,roselle" alt="Fertilizer for Roselle"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Incorporate well-rotted farmyard manure or compost during land preparation to improve soil health.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Fertilizers:</strong> Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizers such as urea or ammonium nitrate during early growth stages to promote leafy growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Use phosphorus (superphosphate) and potassium (muriate of potash) fertilizers at the time of planting to support root development and flower production.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Roselle</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?roselle,disease" alt="Diseases in Roselle"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> A fungal disease causing dark spots on leaves, which can reduce overall plant vigor. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Practice crop rotation and apply fungicides as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that appears as a white powdery substance on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure good air circulation, and avoid overhead watering to minimize humidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> These pests can weaken the plant by sucking sap. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticidal soap or neem oil to manage infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?roselle,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate roselle with other crops to minimize the buildup of soil-borne diseases and pests.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Manage weeds effectively to reduce competition for nutrients and moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to minimize disease incidence in subsequent crops.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Ensure proper irrigation without waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and other diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties of roselle to reduce vulnerability to common diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Roselle grows best in warm temperatures ranging from 70-95째F (21-35째C) and is sensitive to frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Regular watering is essential, especially during dry spells. Ensure the soil is moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 18-24 inches apart to allow adequate airflow and reduce competition for nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, including cultural and biological controls.</li>
