            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Castor</h2>
            <img src="Castor.jpeg" alt="Castor Planting">
            <p>Castor is a drought-resistant, warm-season crop that grows well in tropical and subtropical regions. The best seasons for growing Castor are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> Castor is typically sown during the monsoon season, especially in rain-fed areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In irrigated regions, Castor can be grown during the post-monsoon period for better yield.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Castor can also be planted in summer in areas with sufficient irrigation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,castor" alt="Soil for Castor"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Castor grows well in well-drained soils such as sandy loam, loam, and clay loam, though it can tolerate poor soils as well.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for Castor is between 6.0 and 7.5, though it can tolerate slightly alkaline soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Plow the field thoroughly and add organic matter like compost or manure to improve soil structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Castor</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,castor" alt="Fertilizer for Castor"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced NPK fertilizer (such as 20-10-10) to provide essential nutrients for early growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Incorporate well-decomposed manure or compost to boost soil fertility and moisture retention.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizers during the early vegetative stages for vigorous growth and better yields.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Castor</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?castor,disease" alt="Diseases in Castor"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wilt:</strong> A fungal disease that causes wilting and yellowing of plants. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and maintain proper drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> Affects leaves, causing white powdery patches. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and avoid waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Causes dark spots on leaves, reducing photosynthesis. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and maintain field hygiene.</li>
                <li><strong>Jassids:</strong> A pest that sucks sap from leaves, causing curling and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use neem-based pesticides or other insecticides.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?castor,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate Castor with non-host crops like cereals or legumes to break disease and pest cycles.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve airflow and reduce the risk of fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy affected plant parts to prevent the spread of diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid overwatering and ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging and root rot.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant Castor varieties to reduce losses from common pests and diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?castor,care" alt="Care for Castor"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Castor grows best in warm temperatures ranging from 77-95°F (25-35°C) and can tolerate drought conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Castor is drought-tolerant but requires moderate watering during the early growth stages and flowering.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space Castor plants 30-36 inches apart to allow proper growth and airflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids, jassids, and whiteflies. Use organic pest control methods or insecticides as needed.</li>
