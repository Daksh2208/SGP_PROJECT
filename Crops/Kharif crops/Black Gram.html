            <img src="Black Gram.avif" alt="Black Gram Planting">
            <p>Black gram, also known as urad dal, is a warm-season crop grown in tropical and subtropical regions. It can be grown in the following seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kharif Season:</strong> Ideal for planting during the monsoon season (June-July) in tropical regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Rabi Season:</strong> In certain regions, black gram is also grown during the winter (October-November) as a short-duration crop.</li>
                <li><strong>Zaid Season:</strong> Black gram can also be cultivated during the summer months in areas with adequate irrigation facilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,blackgram" alt="Soil for Black Gram"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Black gram prefers well-drained loamy or clayey soils with good organic matter content.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH is between 6.5 and 7.5, though they can tolerate slightly alkaline soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic manure or compost before planting to enrich the soil.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,blackgram" alt="Fertilizer for Black Gram"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Apply farmyard manure or compost to enhance soil structure and fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Fixing:</strong> Black gram, being a legume, fixes nitrogen in the soil and requires minimal nitrogen fertilizers.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Use fertilizers rich in phosphorus and potassium to promote root development and overall plant growth.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yellow Mosaic Virus:</strong> Causes yellowing and stunting of the plant. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use virus-resistant varieties and control the vector population.</li>
                <li><strong>Wilt:</strong> A fungal disease causing wilting and plant death. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and rotate crops to prevent disease buildup.</li>
                <li><strong>Pod Borer:</strong> Insects that damage the pods and reduce yields. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use biological controls or insecticides when necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Fungal disease that causes dark spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and ensure proper sanitation.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?blackgram,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate crops to prevent the buildup of pests and diseases in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Ensure adequate spacing between plants to allow for air circulation and reduce the risk of fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant residues to limit disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Practices:</strong> Water at the base of plants to avoid wetting the leaves, which reduces the risk of fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Grow disease-resistant black gram varieties to reduce susceptibility to pests and diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Black gram thrives in temperatures between 77-95°F (25-35°C) and is drought-tolerant.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water regularly during the early stages of growth. Black gram can tolerate dry conditions once established.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Plant black gram 12-18 inches apart to allow for proper growth and air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and pod borers. Use appropriate pest control measures when necessary.</li>
