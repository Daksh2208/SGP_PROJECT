            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Black Gram</h2>
            <img src="BlackGram.jpg" alt="Black Gram Planting">
            <p>Black Gram, also known as Urad Dal, is a warm-season crop that grows well in tropical regions. The best seasons for growing Black Gram are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> Black Gram is typically sown during the monsoon season, relying on moderate rainfall for its growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In areas with reliable irrigation systems, it can be grown during the post-monsoon season as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> In certain regions, Black Gram can also be planted in the spring, provided there is enough moisture.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,blackgram" alt="Soil for Black Gram"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Black Gram thrives in well-drained, loamy to sandy loam soils, but it can also grow in clay loam and alluvial soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for Black Gram ranges from 6.0 to 7.5, but it can tolerate slightly acidic conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Prepare the soil by plowing and adding organic matter like compost to enhance soil structure and fertility.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,blackgram" alt="Fertilizer for Black Gram"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced NPK fertilizer (such as 16-32-16) at the time of sowing to provide essential nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost to improve soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> A light application of nitrogenous fertilizers during the early growth stages can enhance plant development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Black Gram</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?blackgram,disease" alt="Diseases in Black Gram"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yellow Mosaic Virus:</strong> Causes yellowing of leaves and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and apply appropriate insecticides to manage vectors.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that causes white powdery growth on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and maintain proper field hygiene.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Affects the root system, causing wilting. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid over-irrigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pod Borer:</strong> A pest that damages developing pods. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply neem-based pesticides or insecticides to manage infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?blackgram,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate Black Gram with other crops such as cereals to break the disease cycle and improve soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Ensure adequate spacing between plants to reduce disease incidence and improve airflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and burn infected plant residues to reduce the risk of disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid overwatering to prevent waterlogging and root-related diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Grow disease-resistant varieties to minimize losses due to common diseases and pests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?blackgram,care" alt="Care for Black Gram"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Black Gram grows best in temperatures ranging from 77-90°F (25-32°C), and it can tolerate high temperatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> It is a drought-tolerant crop but requires moderate watering during the early growth stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space Black Gram plants about 12-15 inches apart to ensure proper growth and aeration.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids, jassids, and pod borers. Use organic pest control measures or insecticides as necessary.</li>
