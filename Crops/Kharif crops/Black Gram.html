            <img src="clusterbeans.jpg" alt="Cluster Beans Planting">
            <p>Cluster beans, also known as guar, are best suited for warm climates and are often grown in tropical and subtropical regions. They can be grown in the following seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> Ideal for planting during the monsoon season (June-July) in tropical regions for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Late Summer:</strong> In regions with mild summers, cluster beans can be planted towards the end of summer for a later harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Dry Season:</strong> Cluster beans are drought-tolerant and can be grown in dry seasons with minimal water requirements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,clusterbeans" alt="Soil for Cluster Beans"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Cluster beans prefer well-drained sandy loam or loamy soils with a good amount of organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH is between 7.0 and 8.0, though they can tolerate slightly alkaline soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate farmyard manure or compost before planting to enrich the soil.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,clusterbeans" alt="Fertilizer for Cluster Beans"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Apply compost or well-decomposed manure to enhance soil fertility and structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen-Fixing:</strong> Since cluster beans are leguminous, they fix nitrogen into the soil and require minimal nitrogen fertilizers.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Supplement the soil with micronutrients like zinc and boron to promote healthy plant development.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?clusterbeans,disease" alt="Diseases in Cluster Beans"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Causes decay of the roots, leading to plant stunting. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper soil drainage and avoid waterlogged conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that causes a white powdery growth on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and plant-resistant varieties.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Causes brown spots on leaves, leading to defoliation. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and practice good sanitation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pod Borer:</strong> Insects that damage the pods and reduce yields. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use biological controls or insecticides when necessary.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?clusterbeans,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate crops to prevent the buildup of pests and diseases in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Ensure sufficient spacing between plants to allow for good air circulation and reduce the risk of fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and dispose of infected plant residues to limit disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Practices:</strong> Water at the base of the plants to avoid wetting the foliage and minimize fungal infection risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Grow disease-resistant cluster bean varieties to reduce susceptibility to pests and diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?clusterbeans,care" alt="Care for Cluster Beans"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Cluster beans thrive in temperatures between 77-95°F (25-35°C) and are highly drought-tolerant.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water regularly during the early stages of growth, but the plants can tolerate dry conditions as they mature.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Plant cluster beans 12-18 inches apart to allow for proper growth and air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and pod borers. Use appropriate control measures as needed.</li>
