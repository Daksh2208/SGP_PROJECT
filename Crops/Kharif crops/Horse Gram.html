            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Horse Gram</h2>
            <img src="Horse Gram.jpeg" alt="Horse Gram Planting">
            <p>Horse gram is a hardy legume that grows well in arid and semi-arid regions. It is typically cultivated in the following seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> Horse gram is often sown at the onset of the rainy season, making use of the monsoon rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In areas with light showers or residual soil moisture after the monsoon, horse gram can be grown as a late-season crop.</li>
                <li><strong>Winter:</strong> In some regions, horse gram is cultivated during the winter months, as it can tolerate cooler temperatures.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,horse-gram" alt="Soil for Horse Gram"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Horse gram thrives in loamy and well-drained soils, and it can tolerate low-fertility soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for horse gram ranges from 5.5 to 7.0. Slightly acidic to neutral soils are preferred.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Plow the field well before sowing, and add organic manure to improve soil structure and fertility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Horse Gram</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,horse-gram" alt="Fertilizer for Horse Gram"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus-Based Fertilizers:</strong> Apply phosphorus fertilizers like superphosphate at sowing time to boost root growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use farmyard manure or compost to improve the organic content and overall fertility of the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal Nitrogen:</strong> Since horse gram is a leguminous crop that fixes nitrogen, it generally requires minimal additional nitrogen input.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Horse Gram</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?horse-gram,disease" alt="Diseases in Horse Gram"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that affects leaves and stems, creating a white powdery coating. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use sulfur-based fungicides and ensure good air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Rust:</strong> Causes rust-colored spots on leaves, reducing plant vigor. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply appropriate fungicides and practice crop rotation to minimize risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Small insects that suck sap from the plant, weakening it. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Neem oil and insecticides can help control infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?horse-gram,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate horse gram with other crops like cereals or oilseeds to prevent soil depletion and disease buildup.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field free from weeds, especially during the early growth stages, to reduce competition for nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove any diseased plant debris to minimize disease outbreaks in subsequent crops.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid over-irrigation, as horse gram is drought-tolerant and excess moisture can lead to disease issues like root rot.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Choose disease-resistant varieties for better crop health and yield.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?horse-gram,care" alt="Care for Horse Gram"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Horse gram prefers temperatures between 70-90°F (21-32°C) and is well-suited for drought-prone areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Minimal irrigation is needed, but ensure sufficient moisture during germination and early growth stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Plant horse gram 6-8 inches apart with proper row spacing to improve air circulation and reduce disease pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic or chemical methods as needed for pest management.</li>
