            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Turmeric</h2>
            <img src="turmeric-field.jpeg" alt="Turmeric Planting">
            <p>Turmeric is a tropical plant that thrives in warm, humid conditions. The best seasons for growing turmeric are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Turmeric is typically planted at the beginning of the monsoon season (June to July) when the soil is moist.</li>
                <li><strong>Harvesting Season:</strong> Harvesting usually occurs 7-10 months after planting, from February to March, when the leaves turn yellow and die back.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,turmeric" alt="Soil for Turmeric"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Turmeric prefers well-drained, fertile soils rich in organic matter. Sandy loam or clay loam soils are ideal.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for turmeric ranges from 5.5 to 7.0.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Prepare the soil by tilling and incorporating organic matter, such as compost or well-rotted manure, to enhance soil fertility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Turmeric</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,turmeric" alt="Fertilizer for Turmeric"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Fertilizers:</strong> Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizers like urea or ammonium nitrate during the early growth stages to promote healthy foliage.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Use phosphorus (single super phosphate) and potassium (muriate of potash) fertilizers at planting to support root and rhizome development.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted farmyard manure during land preparation to improve soil health.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> A fungal disease causing dark spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and practice crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Rhizome Rot:</strong> Fungal disease affecting the rhizomes, leading to decay. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure good drainage and avoid over-watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Small sap-sucking insects that weaken the plant. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use neem oil or insecticidal soap to manage infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?turmeric,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate turmeric with non-host crops to minimize soil-borne diseases and improve soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field free of weeds to reduce competition for nutrients and moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to minimize disease incidence in subsequent crops.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Ensure proper irrigation practices to avoid waterlogging and root diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties of turmeric to reduce vulnerability to common diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?turmeric,care" alt="Care for Turmeric"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Turmeric grows best in warm temperatures between 68-95°F (20-35°C) and requires high humidity for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Regular watering is essential, especially during dry spells. Maintain consistent soil moisture without waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants about 12-18 inches apart to allow for adequate airflow and reduce competition for nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, including cultural and biological controls.</li>
