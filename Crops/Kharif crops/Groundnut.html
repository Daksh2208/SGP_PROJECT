            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Groundnut</h2>
            <img src="Groundnut.webp" alt="Groundnut Planting">
            <p>Groundnut, also known as peanut, is a warm-season crop that grows best in tropical and subtropical climates. It can be cultivated in different seasons based on the region:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> In India and tropical regions, groundnut is usually planted during the monsoon season (June-July) for ideal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In areas with mild winters, groundnut can be planted after the monsoon for a winter harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Groundnut can also be grown during the summer season where irrigation is available.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,groundnut" alt="Soil for Groundnut"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Groundnut grows well in well-drained sandy loam or loamy soils rich in organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The preferred soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.0, but groundnut can tolerate slightly acidic to neutral soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Add compost or well-rotted manure to enhance soil fertility before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,groundnut" alt="Fertilizer for Groundnut"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 20-20-20 to support healthy growth and pod development.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Use compost or well-decomposed farmyard manure to increase organic content in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Adding micronutrients such as zinc and boron can help improve groundnut health and yield.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> A fungal disease causing spots on leaves, leading to defoliation. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and apply fungicides as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Stem Rot:</strong> Causes wilting and rotting of stems. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use disease-free seeds and ensure good soil drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Insects that feed on sap, reducing plant vigor. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticides or biological control methods.</li>
                <li><strong>Pod Rot:</strong> A fungal disease affecting the pods. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve soil drainage and practice crop rotation.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?groundnut,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate groundnut with non-leguminous crops to prevent the buildup of pests and diseases in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Ensure proper plant spacing to enhance air circulation and minimize the risk of fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce the spread of diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Water at the base of the plant to avoid wetting the foliage and reduce fungal disease risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Select disease-resistant groundnut varieties for better management of pests and diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?groundnut,care" alt="Care for Groundnut"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Groundnut thrives in warm temperatures between 70-95°F (21-35°C) and requires full sunlight for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Ensure regular watering during the early stages, but groundnut is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 6-8 inches apart to allow for proper root development and pod formation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Regularly monitor for pests such as aphids and caterpillars, and apply appropriate control measures.</li>
            </ul>
