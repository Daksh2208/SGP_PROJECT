            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Maize</h2>
            <img src="maize.jpeg" alt="Maize Planting">
            <p>Maize, also known as corn, is a versatile cereal crop that can be grown in various seasons depending on the region. The best growing seasons for maize are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kharif (Monsoon):</strong> Maize is predominantly grown as a Kharif crop in India, planted at the onset of the monsoon season.</li>
                <li><strong>Rabi (Winter):</strong> In regions with mild winters and irrigation facilities, maize can also be grown as a Rabi crop.</li>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> In temperate climates, maize is sown during the spring season for summer harvesting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,maize" alt="Soil for Maize"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Maize thrives in well-drained, fertile loamy soils with good organic content. Sandy loam to silty clay loam soils are ideal.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal pH for maize is between 5.8 and 7.0. It can tolerate slightly acidic to neutral soil conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Plow the soil thoroughly and mix organic matter like farmyard manure or compost before sowing to enhance fertility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Maize</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,maize" alt="Fertilizer for Maize"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Fertilizers:</strong> Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizers during the early vegetative stage to promote leaf and stem growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Phosphorus-rich fertilizers (DAP or superphosphate) are essential during planting, while potassium is important for root development.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Apply nitrogen fertilizers in stages (as top dressing) for optimal growth during later stages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Maize</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?maize,disease" alt="Diseases in Maize"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maize Streak Virus:</strong> A viral disease causing streaks on the leaves and reduced crop yield. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use virus-resistant varieties and control insect vectors like aphids.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that causes whitish downy growth on the underside of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and disease-free seeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Blight:</strong> A fungal infection that causes brown spots and drying of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Spray with suitable fungicides and practice crop rotation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?maize,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate maize with legumes or other non-host crops to break pest and disease cycles.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Ensure timely weeding, especially during the early stages, to avoid competition for nutrients and moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and diseased plants from the field to prevent the spread of infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid waterlogging and use irrigation during dry spells to ensure consistent soil moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease- and pest-resistant varieties to minimize losses from common maize diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?maize,care" alt="Care for Maize"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Maize grows best in warm temperatures ranging from 70-90°F (21-32°C). It requires a frost-free environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Maize needs consistent moisture, particularly during the flowering and grain-filling stages. Irrigate during dry periods for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Sow maize seeds 8-12 inches apart with rows spaced 24-36 inches apart to ensure proper airflow and avoid overcrowding.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Keep an eye out for common pests like corn borers and cutworms. Use organic or chemical pest control methods as needed.</li>
