            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Jowar</h2>
            <img src="Jowar.jpg" alt="Jowar Planting">
            <p>Jowar, also known as sorghum, is a versatile crop that grows well in both tropical and temperate regions. It can be planted in different seasons based on regional climate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> In India, jowar is usually sown during the monsoon season (June-July) to take advantage of the rains.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In regions with a second rainy season, jowar can be planted in the post-monsoon period (September-October).</li>
                <li><strong>Rabi Season:</strong> In some areas, jowar is grown as a rabi crop in the cooler months after the main rainy season.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,jowar" alt="Soil for Jowar"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Jowar thrives in well-drained loamy or sandy loam soils but can also tolerate clay soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for jowar is between 6.0 and 7.5, though it can tolerate slightly alkaline soils as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Plow the soil thoroughly and add compost or farmyard manure to enrich the soil before sowing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Jowar</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,jowar" alt="Fertilizer for Jowar"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 20-20-20 or 15-15-15 to promote healthy growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Add micronutrients such as zinc and iron if deficiency symptoms appear during the crop growth stage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Jowar</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?jowar,disease" alt="Diseases in Jowar"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaf Blight:</strong> A fungal disease that causes leaf lesions and hampers photosynthesis. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and fungicides where necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Smut:</strong> A fungal disease that affects the grains, turning them into spore masses. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Seed treatment and using smut-resistant varieties help control the spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Shoot Fly:</strong> A common pest that attacks young jowar plants. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticides or biological control methods.</li>
                <li><strong>Anthracnose:</strong> A fungal disease that causes dark spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Rotate crops and apply fungicides as needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?jowar,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate jowar with other crops like legumes to break the disease cycle in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants appropriately to allow good air circulation and prevent moisture buildup, which can lead to diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove infected plant debris and weeds to minimize disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Avoid overhead irrigation to reduce the risk of fungal infections. Water at the base of the plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Choose jowar varieties that are resistant to common pests and diseases for a healthier crop.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?jowar,care" alt="Care for Jowar"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Jowar grows best in temperatures ranging from 75-95°F (24-35°C) and can withstand hot, dry conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water the crop adequately during the early growth stages. Jowar is drought-resistant and can tolerate dry conditions as it matures.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Keep plants spaced 18-24 inches apart to allow for proper growth and airflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as stem borers and aphids. Use integrated pest management methods to control infestations.</li>
