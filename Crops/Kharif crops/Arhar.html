            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Arhar</h2>
            <img src="arhar.jpg" alt="Arhar Planting">
            <p>Arhar, also known as pigeon pea, is a warm-season crop that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It can be grown in various seasons depending on the region:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> In India and other tropical regions, arhar is typically planted during the monsoon season (June-July) for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In regions with mild winters, arhar can also be planted after the monsoon for a winter harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Dry Season:</strong> Arhar is drought-tolerant and can be grown in dry seasons with minimal water requirements.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,arhar" alt="Soil for Arhar"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Arhar prefers well-drained loamy or sandy loam soil with good organic content.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.5, but arhar is known to tolerate slightly acidic to neutral soil conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Add compost or farmyard manure to enrich the soil and improve its fertility before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 20-20-20 to support healthy growth and development.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure to enhance the organic matter in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Arhar may benefit from the addition of micronutrients like zinc and boron to improve plant health.</li>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Arhar</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?arhar,disease" alt="Diseases in Arhar"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wilt:</strong> A fungal disease that causes plants to wilt and die prematurely. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and ensure proper crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Blight:</strong> Causes leaf spots and can lead to defoliation. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and practice good field hygiene.</li>
                <li><strong>Pod Borer:</strong> Caterpillars that damage pods and reduce yields. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use biological control methods or insecticides as necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Affects roots, leading to stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure good soil drainage and avoid overwatering.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?arhar,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Practice crop rotation to reduce the buildup of pathogens in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to promote air circulation and reduce humidity, which can lead to fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant debris to minimize the spread of diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Water plants at the base to avoid wetting the foliage and reduce the risk of fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant disease-resistant varieties of arhar for better management of common pests and diseases.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Arhar thrives in warm temperatures between 75-90°F (24-32°C) and can tolerate drought conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water regularly during early growth stages, but arhar is drought-tolerant and can withstand dry spells during maturity.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 18-24 inches apart to allow for adequate root and canopy development.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like pod borers and aphids. Use organic or chemical control methods as necessary.</li>
