                <h3>Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Arhar thrives in warm climates. Ideal temperatures range from 25째C to 35째C (77째F to 95째F). It is tolerant to drought but sensitive to frost and excessive moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Arhar requires full sunlight for proper growth and development. It is a day-neutral plant, meaning it flowers regardless of day length.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> The best time to plant Arhar is during the monsoon season, typically from June to July in tropical and subtropical regions.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Arhar grows best in well-drained loamy soils, but it can tolerate a variety of soil types, including light sandy soils and heavy clays.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal pH range is between 6.0 and 7.5. Arhar can tolerate slightly acidic to neutral soil conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fertility:</strong> Arhar requires a moderate amount of nutrients and benefits from nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil. Adding compost or organic matter enhances soil fertility.</li>

                <h3>Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seeds:</strong> Arhar seeds should be sown at a depth of 5-7 cm, with a spacing of 25-30 cm between plants. Germination typically occurs within 7 to 10 days under warm conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moisture:</strong> The soil should be moist but not waterlogged at the time of planting. Arhar can tolerate drought but needs adequate moisture during the germination and flowering stages.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Weed Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Manual Weeding:</strong> Regular weeding during the first two months is essential for controlling weeds and ensuring healthy growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Control:</strong> Pre-emergence herbicides may be used after sowing to suppress early weed competition. However, mechanical cultivation is preferable to avoid chemical buildup in the soil.</li>
