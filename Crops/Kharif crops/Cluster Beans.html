            <p>Cluster beans, also known as Guar, are a hardy leguminous crop that thrives in warm and arid climates. The best seasons for growing cluster beans are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Cluster beans are typically sown during the summer season, where they grow well in hot conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> In regions receiving monsoon rainfall, cluster beans can be planted at the beginning of the rainy season for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In semi-arid regions, cluster beans can also be cultivated after the monsoon season, using irrigation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,cluster-beans" alt="Soil for Cluster Beans"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Cluster beans thrive in sandy loam and well-drained soils. It can tolerate low-fertility soils but benefits from organic-rich soil.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for cluster beans ranges from 6.0 to 7.5. They tolerate slightly alkaline soils as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Plow the soil thoroughly and mix organic matter like compost or manure to improve fertility and soil structure before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Cluster Beans</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,cluster-beans" alt="Fertilizer for Cluster Beans"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus-Rich Fertilizers:</strong> Apply phosphorus-based fertilizers like superphosphate at the time of sowing to enhance root development.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost, farmyard manure, or vermicompost to improve soil fertility and structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Top dress the crop with nitrogenous fertilizers during early growth stages to promote vegetative growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cluster-beans,disease" alt="Diseases in Cluster Beans"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> This fungal disease causes brown or black spots on leaves, reducing plant growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and crop rotation to prevent the spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Affects the roots, leading to wilting and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid over-irrigation to reduce the risk of root rot.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> These small insects suck plant sap, weakening the crop. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use neem oil or insecticides to manage aphid infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cluster-beans,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate cluster beans with other crops like cereals to minimize soil-borne diseases and improve soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field free of weeds, especially during the early growth stage, to ensure healthy plant growth and avoid competition for nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy diseased plant debris from the field to reduce the risk of disease outbreaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid over-irrigation to prevent diseases like root rot and ensure proper drainage in the field.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant disease-resistant varieties of cluster beans to reduce vulnerability to common diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cluster-beans,care" alt="Care for Cluster Beans"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Cluster beans grow best in temperatures between 77-95°F (25-35°C) and are highly tolerant to heat and drought conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Although drought-tolerant, cluster beans require consistent moisture during the early growth stages. Irrigation is necessary in dry regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 12-18 inches apart and maintain proper row spacing to allow airflow and reduce the risk of disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Keep an eye on common pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic insecticides or chemical sprays as needed to control infestations.</li>
