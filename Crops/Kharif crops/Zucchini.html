            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Zucchini</h2>
            <img src="zucchini-field.jpeg" alt="Zucchini Planting">
            <p>Zucchini is a warm-season vegetable that thrives in sunny, frost-free conditions. The best seasons for growing zucchini are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Zucchini is typically planted in early spring after the last frost for optimal growth (March to May).</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Zucchini can also be grown throughout summer in temperate regions, with harvests continuing until fall.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,zucchini" alt="Soil for Zucchini"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Zucchini thrives in well-drained, loamy soils rich in organic matter. Avoid waterlogged soils to prevent root diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for zucchini ranges from 6.0 to 7.5, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure into the soil to improve fertility and moisture retention.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Zucchini</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,zucchini" alt="Fertilizer for Zucchini"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting to provide essential nutrients for strong growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost or well-rotted manure to increase soil fertility and promote healthy plant development.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Apply a nitrogen-rich fertilizer during flowering and fruit development to enhance fruit yield and quality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Zucchini</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?zucchini,disease" alt="Diseases in Zucchini"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that causes white powdery spots on leaves, reducing photosynthesis. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and plant-resistant varieties to manage the disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Blossom End Rot:</strong> A physiological disorder that causes fruit rot at the blossom end. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure consistent moisture levels and provide adequate calcium to prevent this condition.</li>
                <li><strong>Squash Bugs:</strong> Insects that suck sap from zucchini plants, causing wilting. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use organic insecticides or practice crop rotation to minimize infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?zucchini,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate zucchini with non-cucurbit crops to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases and pest buildup.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field free of weeds during the early growth stages to prevent competition for nutrients and water.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove diseased or infested plant debris from the field to reduce the risk of pest and disease outbreaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Use drip irrigation or water at the base of the plants to prevent fungal infections like powdery mildew.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant disease-resistant zucchini varieties to reduce the risk of common diseases like powdery mildew.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?zucchini,care" alt="Care for Zucchini"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Zucchini grows best in temperatures between 70-85°F (21-29°C). Frost will kill the plant, so ensure it's planted after the last frost date.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Zucchini requires consistent moisture, especially during fruit development. Avoid wetting the leaves to reduce disease risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space zucchini plants about 24-36 inches apart in rows that are 3-5 feet apart to allow proper air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like squash bugs, cucumber beetles, and aphids. Use integrated pest management strategies to control infestations.</li>
