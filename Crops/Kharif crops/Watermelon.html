            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Watermelons</h2>
            <img src="watermelon-field.jpeg" alt="Watermelon Planting">
            <p>Watermelon is a warm-season crop that thrives in hot, sunny climates. The best seasons for growing watermelons are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Watermelons are usually planted during the late spring to summer months for optimal growth (March to June).</li>
                <li><strong>Winter:</strong> In tropical and subtropical regions, watermelons can also be grown during the winter months with proper irrigation (November to February).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,watermelon" alt="Soil for Watermelon"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Watermelons thrive in well-drained, sandy loam soils that are rich in organic matter. They do not tolerate waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for watermelon ranges from 6.0 to 7.5, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Prepare the soil by plowing and adding organic manure or compost to improve fertility and moisture retention.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Watermelon</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,watermelon" alt="Fertilizer for Watermelon"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced NPK Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) fertilizer at planting for healthy growth. A common ratio is 10-10-10.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost, farmyard manure, or green manure to enhance soil structure and fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizers as a top dressing during the vine and fruit development stages to promote vegetative and reproductive growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Watermelon</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?watermelon,disease" alt="Diseases in Watermelon"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fusarium Wilt:</strong> A soil-borne fungal disease that causes wilting and yellowing of vines. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties and practice crop rotation to reduce soil infection.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that causes yellow spots on leaves, reducing photosynthesis. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and ensure proper air circulation by spacing plants correctly.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Small insects that suck sap from the leaves, causing stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use neem oil or insecticides to manage aphid infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?watermelon,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate watermelons with non-cucurbit crops to reduce soil-borne diseases like Fusarium Wilt.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field free from weeds during early growth stages to reduce competition for nutrients and water.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy diseased plant debris from the field to minimize the spread of diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Watermelons require consistent moisture but should not be waterlogged. Use drip irrigation or furrow irrigation to provide water efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant disease-resistant varieties to reduce susceptibility to common diseases like Fusarium Wilt and Downy Mildew.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?watermelon,care" alt="Care for Watermelon"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Watermelons require warm temperatures between 70-90°F (21-32°C) for optimal growth and are sensitive to frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Consistent moisture is necessary, especially during flowering and fruit set. Avoid over-watering during fruit maturity to prevent cracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space watermelon plants about 2-3 feet apart in rows that are 6-8 feet apart to allow proper vine growth and air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids and beetles. Use integrated pest management strategies, including organic or chemical treatments, to control infestations.</li>
