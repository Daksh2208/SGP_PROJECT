            <img src="ragi-field.jpeg" alt="Ragi Planting">
            <p>Ragi, also known as finger millet, is a drought-resistant cereal crop well-suited for dryland farming. The best seasons for growing ragi are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kharif Season:</strong> Ragi is typically sown during the kharif season (June to July) and harvested in September to October, relying on the monsoon rains.</li>
                <li><strong>Rabi Season:</strong> In some regions, ragi can also be sown in the rabi season (October to November) and harvested in February to March.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,ragi" alt="Soil for Ragi"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Ragi thrives in well-drained sandy loam, loamy, or clayey soils. It can tolerate low-fertility soils but prefers fertile and well-structured soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for ragi ranges from 6.0 to 7.5. It can adapt to slightly acidic and neutral soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Prepare the soil by plowing and mixing organic matter like compost or green manure to enhance fertility before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Ragi</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,ragi" alt="Fertilizer for Ragi"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Incorporate well-rotted farmyard manure or compost during land preparation to improve soil health.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen Fertilizers:</strong> Apply nitrogen fertilizers such as urea or ammonium sulfate during early growth stages to promote vegetative development.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Use phosphorus (single super phosphate) and potassium (muriate of potash) fertilizers at the time of planting to support root development and overall plant health.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Ragi</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?ragi,disease" alt="Diseases in Ragi"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blast Disease:</strong> A fungal disease that affects leaves and spikes, leading to significant yield loss. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and apply fungicides if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> This fungal disease causes brown spots on leaves, reducing the plant's vigor. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Practice crop rotation and apply appropriate fungicides.</li>
                <li><strong>Red Rot:</strong> A serious disease affecting the stem, causing lodging. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and maintain good field sanitation practices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?ragi,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate ragi with legumes or other cereals to break disease cycles and improve soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Effectively manage weeds to reduce competition for nutrients and moisture, especially during the early growth stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to minimize disease incidence in subsequent crops.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> While ragi is drought-resistant, adequate moisture during critical growth stages (germination and flowering) is crucial.</li>
