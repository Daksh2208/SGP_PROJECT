            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Ragi</h2>
            <img src="Ragi.webp" alt="Ragi Planting">
            <p>Ragi is a hardy crop that grows well in arid and semi-arid regions. It can be cultivated in the following seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> Ideal for planting in rainfed regions, with sowing beginning at the onset of rains.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In areas with residual moisture after monsoon, ragi can be planted for a post-monsoon harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Winter:</strong> In cooler climates, ragi can be grown during winter months under irrigation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,ragi" alt="Soil for Ragi"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Ragi thrives in well-drained sandy loam or clay loam soils with moderate organic content.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for ragi is between 5.0 and 7.5, although it can tolerate slightly acidic soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter like compost or manure into the soil to improve fertility before planting ragi.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost should be applied to enhance soil health.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutrient Balance:</strong> Ragi benefits from balanced fertilizers, particularly those rich in phosphorus and potassium.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Ensure the availability of micronutrients like zinc and iron for the healthy growth of ragi.</li>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?ragi,disease" alt="Diseases in Ragi"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blast Disease:</strong> A fungal disease causing lesions on leaves and stems. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and apply fungicides if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Affects the root system, leading to wilting. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Neck Blast:</strong> Causes damage to the grain neck area, resulting in poor grain filling. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Spray fungicides and adopt proper nutrient management.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Sap-sucking insects that hinder growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use organic pest controls or insecticidal sprays.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate ragi with legumes or other crops to break the disease cycle and improve soil health.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Ensure adequate spacing between plants to reduce fungal disease spread and promote air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove diseased plant material and debris to prevent the spread of infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Practices:</strong> Avoid excessive irrigation and ensure well-drained fields to reduce fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Select disease-resistant varieties for improved yield and reduced losses.</li>
            </ul>
