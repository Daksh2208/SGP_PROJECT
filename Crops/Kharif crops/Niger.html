            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Niger</h2>
            <img src="niger-seeds.jpeg" alt="Niger Planting">
            <p>Niger (Guizotia abyssinica) is an oilseed crop cultivated mainly in dry and arid regions. It is hardy and grows well in regions with poor soil fertility. The best seasons for growing niger are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kharif Season:</strong> Niger is usually sown during the monsoon season (June-July), especially in rainfed areas where it relies on seasonal rains.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon Season:</strong> In some regions, niger can be sown after the monsoon using residual soil moisture, especially in semi-arid areas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,niger" alt="Soil for Niger"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Niger thrives in well-drained, light-textured soils, including sandy loam, loam, and even gravelly soils. It is well-suited to low-fertility soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for niger cultivation is between 5.2 and 7.5. Niger can tolerate slightly acidic to neutral soil conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Minimal soil preparation is needed, but plowing the field to break up the soil and mixing in organic matter, such as compost, can improve yield.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Niger</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,niger" alt="Fertilizer for Niger"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Niger is a low-input crop and responds well to organic fertilizers like farmyard manure or compost during soil preparation.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Small doses of phosphorus and potassium can help improve growth and seed yield. Apply phosphorus-based fertilizers at sowing time.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Nitrogen Requirement:</strong> Niger does not require heavy nitrogen fertilization, but a light dose during early growth stages can promote better foliage and flowering.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Niger</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?niger,disease" alt="Diseases in Niger"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alternaria Leaf Spot:</strong> Fungal disease causing dark spots on leaves, reducing photosynthesis. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and plant disease-resistant varieties.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> White powdery fungal growth on leaves, affecting plant health. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply sulfur-based fungicides and avoid overhead irrigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Stem Borers:</strong> Insect larvae that bore into stems, weakening the plant. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticides or biological controls to manage stem borer infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?niger,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate niger with legumes or cereals to prevent the buildup of pests and diseases in the soil and improve soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field free of weeds, especially during early stages, to prevent competition for moisture and nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove diseased plant debris and ensure proper sanitation in the field to reduce disease pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Niger requires minimal irrigation. Ensure proper drainage, and avoid overwatering to prevent root-related diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?niger,care" alt="Care for Niger"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Niger grows well in warm climates with temperatures ranging from 70-90°F (21-32°C). It is drought-tolerant and adapted to dry conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Niger is a rainfed crop and generally does not require additional irrigation. However, supplemental irrigation can improve yields in areas with insufficient rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 12-18 inches apart to ensure proper airflow, reduce the risk of disease, and allow adequate space for plant development.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Keep an eye on common pests like stem borers and aphids. Use organic or chemical insecticides as needed to control infestations.</li>
