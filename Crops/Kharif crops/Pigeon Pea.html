            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Pigeon Peas</h2>
            <img src="Pigeon Pea.webp" alt="Pigeon Pea Planting">
            <p>Pigeon peas, also known as red gram, thrive in warm climates and are commonly grown in tropical and subtropical regions. The best seasons for growing pigeon peas are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> Ideal for sowing during the onset of the monsoon (June-July), which provides adequate moisture for early growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In areas with extended rainy seasons, pigeon peas can be planted towards the end of the monsoon for a second harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Pigeon peas can also be grown during the winter season in regions with mild temperatures.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,pigeonpea" alt="Soil for Pigeon Peas"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Pigeon peas grow well in well-drained loamy or clay soils with good organic matter content.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.5, making it suitable for slightly acidic to neutral soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Add farmyard manure or compost to improve soil fertility and structure before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,pigeonpea" alt="Fertilizer for Pigeon Peas"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use well-decomposed manure or compost to improve soil quality and promote growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizers for root development and better yields.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Supplement with zinc and molybdenum to improve plant vigor and enhance nitrogen fixation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Pigeon Peas</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?pigeonpea,disease" alt="Diseases in Pigeon Peas"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wilt Disease:</strong> Causes wilting and yellowing of plants. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties and maintain proper crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Stem Canker:</strong> Fungal disease causing lesions on stems. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and remove affected plants promptly.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Results in brown spots on leaves, leading to defoliation. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use appropriate fungicides and practice good field hygiene.</li>
                <li><strong>Pod Borer:</strong> Insects that attack pigeon pea pods, reducing yield. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use biological or chemical pest control methods when necessary.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?pigeonpea,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate pigeon peas with non-leguminous crops to prevent soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to promote air circulation and reduce disease risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove infected plant residues from the field to control disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Practices:</strong> Avoid overwatering and ensure proper soil drainage to minimize fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Opt for disease-resistant pigeon pea varieties to minimize pest and disease damage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?pigeonpea,care" alt="Care for Pigeon Peas"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Pigeon peas thrive in temperatures ranging from 68-95°F (20-35°C) and tolerate dry conditions well.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water young plants regularly, but pigeon peas are drought-tolerant once established.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Plant pigeon peas 18-24 inches apart to ensure proper growth and air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Keep an eye out for aphids, pod borers, and other pests, and apply necessary control measures.</li>
