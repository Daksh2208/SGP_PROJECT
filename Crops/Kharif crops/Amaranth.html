                <h3>Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Amaranth thrives in warm climates. Ideal temperatures for growth range from 21째C to 30째C (70째F to 86째F). It is sensitive to frost but can withstand higher temperatures if adequately watered.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Amaranth grows best in full sunlight. It is a day-neutral plant, meaning its flowering is not heavily influenced by the length of the day.</li>

                <h3>Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Amaranth is usually planted in late spring or early summer, once the danger of frost has passed.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Amaranth prefers well-drained, loamy soil but can adapt to various soil types, including sandy and clayey soils.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal pH level for amaranth is between 6.0 and 7.5. It can tolerate slightly acidic to neutral soils.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fertility:</strong> Amaranth can grow in relatively poor soils but responds well to nutrient-rich, organic matter in the soil.</li>

                <h3>Types of Fertilizers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Organic fertilizers such as compost, manure, and bone meal work well for amaranth, promoting healthy growth and seed production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inorganic Fertilizers:</strong> Inorganic fertilizers like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) compounds can be used, but sparingly, to avoid excessive vegetative growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="schedule">
                <h3>Fertilization Schedule</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Early Spring:</strong> Apply compost or a balanced fertilizer during soil preparation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mid Growing Season:</strong> Apply nitrogen-rich fertilizers if the plants show signs of nitrogen deficiency, such as yellowing of leaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Late Season:</strong> Reduce fertilization as the plant approaches the seed production stage to prevent excessive leafy growth.</li>

                <h3>Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seeds:</strong> Amaranth seeds are tiny and can be directly sown into prepared soil. Germination typically occurs within 7 to 10 days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moisture:</strong> Ensure the soil is moist but not waterlogged. Amaranth is drought-tolerant but grows best with consistent moisture.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mulching:</strong> Applying mulch can help suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultivation:</strong> Light cultivation is recommended to control weeds, especially during early growth stages.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Dark spots or blotches on leaves, which may lead to leaf drop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conditions:</strong> Humid conditions and poor air circulation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control:</strong> Remove affected leaves and ensure proper spacing between plants for air circulation.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Amaranth is ready for harvest when the seed heads begin to turn brown and dry, usually 90 to 120 days after planting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Cut the seed heads off the plants and allow them to dry in a warm, well-ventilated area before threshing the seeds.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="post-harvest-care">
                <h3>Post-Harvest Care</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Threshing:</strong> Once the seed heads are fully dry, gently rub them to separate the seeds from the chaff.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store the seeds in a cool, dry place. Properly stored seeds can last for several years.</li>
