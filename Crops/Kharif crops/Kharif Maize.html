            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Kharif Maize</h2>
            <img src="Kharif Maize.avif" alt="Maize Planting">
            <p>Kharif maize, commonly grown during the rainy season, is a vital crop in tropical and subtropical regions. It can be cultivated in various seasons depending on the region:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> In most parts of India, maize is planted during the monsoon (June-July) to benefit from the seasonal rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In areas with irrigation facilities, maize can also be grown after the monsoon for a second crop.</li>
                <li><strong>Rainfed Regions:</strong> Maize is suited for rainfed conditions, especially in regions with heavy rainfall.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,maize" alt="Soil for Maize"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Kharif maize thrives in well-drained loamy or sandy loam soil with good fertility and organic content.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for maize ranges from 5.5 to 7.5, but it can tolerate slightly acidic to neutral conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or organic manure to improve soil structure and fertility before sowing.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use fertilizers with an NPK ratio of 20-20-0 or 18-46-0 to support vigorous maize growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Incorporate organic compost or farmyard manure to enhance the soil's nutrient-holding capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Zinc, sulfur, and boron supplementation may be necessary for maize, depending on the soil test results.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stem Rot:</strong> A fungal disease that affects the stem, causing lodging. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use crop rotation and resistant varieties.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Blight:</strong> Causes leaf spots, leading to reduced photosynthesis. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and ensure good field hygiene.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall Armyworm:</strong> A destructive pest that feeds on maize leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use biological controls or insecticides as required.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Affects the growth of maize, leading to poor development. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and fungicide applications.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?maize,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate crops with legumes or other crops to prevent disease buildup in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Ensure adequate spacing between plants to promote airflow and reduce humidity that can cause diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Regularly remove and destroy infected plant debris to avoid the spread of pathogens.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Water at the base of plants to keep the foliage dry and reduce fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant disease-resistant varieties of maize for better disease management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?maize,care" alt="Care for Maize"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Maize prefers warm temperatures between 70-85°F (21-29°C) for optimal growth and yield.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Ensure regular watering during the critical growth stages of maize, especially during flowering and cob development.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space maize plants about 24-30 inches apart to allow sufficient room for root and canopy development.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like fall armyworm, and apply pest control measures, including organic or chemical options, as needed.</li>
