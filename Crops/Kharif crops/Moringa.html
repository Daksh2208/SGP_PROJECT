            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Moringa</h2>
            <img src="moringa.jpg" alt="Moringa Planting">
            <p>Moringa, also known as the drumstick tree, is a versatile crop that grows well in tropical and subtropical climates. It can be cultivated in different seasons based on the region:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> In tropical regions like India, moringa is often planted during the monsoon (June-July) for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> In areas with mild winters, moringa can also be planted in spring for a summer harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Dry Season:</strong> Moringa is drought-resistant and can be grown successfully with minimal water during dry seasons.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Moringa thrives in well-drained sandy or loamy soils with good fertility and organic content.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH range is 6.3 to 7.0, though moringa can tolerate slightly acidic to neutral soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter like compost or manure to improve soil fertility before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost or well-rotted manure to enhance soil organic matter and promote healthy plant growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer (10-10-10) to ensure moringa receives essential nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Supplement with micronutrients such as iron and magnesium to support optimal growth.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Affects roots, stunting plant growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid overwatering.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Causes spots on leaves and can lead to defoliation. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and remove affected plant parts.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Small insects that feed on plant sap. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use organic insecticides or introduce natural predators.</li>
                <li><strong>Fruit Rot:</strong> A fungal disease that affects pods. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure good air circulation and use disease-resistant varieties.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Moringa grows best in warm temperatures between 77-95°F (25-35°C) and can tolerate dry conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water regularly during early growth but reduce irrigation once the plant is established as it is drought-tolerant.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants about 10-15 feet apart to allow for proper root development and airflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic or chemical controls as needed.</li>
