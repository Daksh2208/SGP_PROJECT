            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Soybean</h2>
            <img src="soybean-field.jpeg" alt="Soybean Planting">
            <p>Soybean is a warm-season legume crop that thrives in moderate to warm temperatures. The best seasons for growing soybeans are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Soybeans are typically sown in late spring (April to June) when soil temperatures reach around 55째F (13째C) or higher.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> The crop is grown during summer and harvested in late summer to early fall (September to October).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,soybean" alt="Soil for Soybean"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Soybeans prefer well-drained loamy or sandy loam soils with good moisture retention.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for soybeans ranges from 6.0 to 7.0, with slight tolerance to acidic conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Prepare the soil by plowing and incorporating organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure to enhance soil fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Soybean</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,soybean" alt="Fertilizer for Soybean"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inoculation:</strong> Inoculate seeds with rhizobium bacteria to enhance nitrogen fixation in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Incorporate well-rotted farmyard manure or compost during land preparation to improve soil health.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen and Phosphorus:</strong> Apply phosphorus (single super phosphate) at planting to support root development, and nitrogen can be supplemented if necessary based on soil tests.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="diseases">
            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Soybean</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soybean,disease" alt="Diseases in Soybean"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that appears as white powder on leaves, reducing yield. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and apply fungicides as necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Affects the roots and leads to wilting. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid over-watering to reduce the risk of root diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> These pests can weaken the plants by sucking sap. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use neem oil or insecticidal soap to manage infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soybean,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate soybeans with cereals or other crops to minimize soil-borne diseases and improve soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Manage weeds effectively to reduce competition for nutrients and moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to minimize disease incidence in subsequent crops.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Maintain optimal moisture levels without waterlogging, which can lead to root diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties of soybean to reduce vulnerability to common diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soybean,care" alt="Care for Soybean"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Soybeans grow best in warm temperatures ranging from 70-95째F (21-35째C) and are sensitive to frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Regular watering is essential, especially during the flowering and pod-setting stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 15-30 inches apart, depending on the row spacing and variety, to allow adequate airflow and reduce competition for nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like aphids, beetles, and caterpillars. Use integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, including cultural and biological controls.</li>
