            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Kulthi</h2>
            <img src="Kulthi.jpeg" alt="Kulthi Planting">
            <p>Kulthi (Horse Gram) is a hardy legume, primarily cultivated in rainfed areas. It grows best in the following seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kharif (Monsoon):</strong> Kulthi is often sown at the beginning of the monsoon season to benefit from natural rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Rabi (Post-Monsoon):</strong> In regions with good residual moisture or irrigation facilities, it can also be sown as a Rabi crop after the monsoon.</li>
                <li><strong>Late Summer:</strong> In some regions, Kulthi can be grown in late summer when other crops are not feasible.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,kulthi" alt="Soil for Kulthi"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Kulthi thrives in sandy loam or light soils that are well-drained, but it can grow in a variety of soil types, including poor or degraded soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> It prefers slightly acidic to neutral soils, with a pH range of 5.5 to 6.5 being optimal.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Before sowing, prepare the soil with organic matter such as farmyard manure to improve fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Kulthi</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,kulthi" alt="Fertilizer for Kulthi"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus:</strong> Apply phosphorus-rich fertilizers, like superphosphate, during sowing to encourage root development.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Manure:</strong> Use well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost to enrich the soil with nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal Nitrogen:</strong> Kulthi, being a legume, fixes its own nitrogen, so minimal additional nitrogen is required.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Kulthi</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?kulthi,disease" alt="Diseases in Kulthi"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anthracnose:</strong> A fungal disease that causes dark spots on leaves and stems, reducing yield. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and crop rotation to minimize the spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Fungal infections can cause small circular spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Spray with suitable fungicides and practice proper field hygiene.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Sap-sucking insects that weaken the plants. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Neem oil or insecticides can be used to manage aphid infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?kulthi,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate Kulthi with other crops like cereals or oilseeds to prevent the buildup of diseases and improve soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Ensure proper weed management, especially during the early stages of growth, to avoid competition for nutrients and moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove diseased plants and debris from the field to reduce the risk of spreading infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid waterlogging as Kulthi is drought-tolerant but sensitive to excessive moisture. Provide only minimal irrigation if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties of Kulthi to minimize loss due to pests and diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?kulthi,care" alt="Care for Kulthi"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Kulthi grows best in warm conditions with temperatures ranging from 70-85°F (21-29°C). It is highly tolerant of dry and drought-prone areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Since Kulthi is a drought-resistant crop, minimal irrigation is required. Ensure adequate moisture during the germination and early growth stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Sow seeds 8-10 inches apart with rows spaced 18-20 inches apart to allow good airflow and reduce disease risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and caterpillars. Use appropriate organic or chemical pest control methods as needed.</li>
