            <img src="Elephant Foot Yam.jpeg" alt="Elephant Foot Yam Planting">
            <p>Elephant Foot Yam is a tropical root vegetable that grows best in warm and humid climates. The ideal seasons for growing Elephant Foot Yam are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> Planting usually begins with the onset of the monsoon season (June-July), providing necessary moisture for initial growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In areas with mild winters, planting can also occur after the monsoon for better soil conditions and harvest in the dry season.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> In some regions, Elephant Foot Yam can be grown during the summer, provided there is access to irrigation.</li>
            </ul>
