            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Urad</h2>
            <img src="Urad.jpeg" alt="Urad Planting">
            <p>Urad, also known as black gram, is a leguminous crop that thrives in warm and tropical climates. It can be grown in the following seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kharif Season:</strong> Ideal for planting in the monsoon, especially in tropical and subtropical regions, as the crop requires a warm and humid environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Rabi Season:</strong> In some regions, urad is grown in the winter with minimal irrigation for a rabi harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Urad can also be planted in spring for a summer harvest, particularly in areas with controlled irrigation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,urad" alt="Soil for Urad"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Urad grows well in well-drained loamy or sandy soils that retain moisture while ensuring drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.5 for best growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter such as compost or green manure to improve soil fertility before planting urad.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Urad</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,urad" alt="Fertilizer for Urad"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Well-rotted manure or compost enhances soil quality and provides necessary nutrients for urad.</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer with moderate nitrogen, as urad can fix its own nitrogen but benefits from phosphorus and potassium.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Ensure adequate micronutrients, particularly zinc and boron, for healthy plant development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Urad</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?urad,disease" alt="Diseases in Urad"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yellow Mosaic Virus:</strong> Causes yellow spots on leaves and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use virus-resistant varieties and control insect vectors like whiteflies.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> Appears as white powdery spots on leaves and stems. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and maintain proper plant spacing.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Fungal disease that causes roots to decay. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure well-drained soils and avoid waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Thrips:</strong> Tiny insects that feed on plant sap, leading to reduced yields. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticides or biological controls as needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?urad,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate urad with non-leguminous crops to reduce disease and pest buildup.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Maintain adequate spacing to ensure air circulation and reduce the spread of diseases like powdery mildew.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove diseased plants and residues to prevent the spread of infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Practices:</strong> Avoid over-irrigation and ensure proper drainage to reduce root-related diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant urad varieties to minimize the occurrence of pests and diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Urad thrives in temperatures between 77-86°F (25-30°C) and can tolerate drought conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Though urad is drought-tolerant, it requires regular watering during the flowering and pod-filling stages for optimal yield.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Sow seeds 12-15 inches apart for proper growth and air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as thrips and aphids. Apply appropriate biological or chemical treatments when necessary.</li>
