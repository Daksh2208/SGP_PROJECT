            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Moth Beans</h2>
            <img src="moth-beans.jpeg" alt="Moth Beans Planting">
            <p>Moth beans are a hardy, drought-tolerant crop grown primarily in arid and semi-arid regions. The best seasons for growing moth beans are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kharif Season:</strong> Moth beans are mainly cultivated during the monsoon season (July to September) in India and other regions with similar climates.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer Season:</strong> In areas with irrigation, moth beans can also be grown in the summer months.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,moth-beans" alt="Soil for Moth Beans"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Moth beans thrive in sandy loam and well-drained soils. They perform well in low-fertility soils and are known to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its quality.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for moth beans is between 6.0 and 7.5. They can tolerate slightly acidic and alkaline soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Plow the soil thoroughly and ensure it is well-drained. Add organic matter like compost to improve fertility before sowing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Moth Beans</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,moth-beans" alt="Fertilizer for Moth Beans"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use compost or farmyard manure to improve soil structure and fertility during soil preparation.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus-Rich Fertilizers:</strong> Phosphorus-based fertilizers like DAP or superphosphate can be applied at sowing time to enhance root development.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Dressing:</strong> Moth beans generally do not require heavy fertilization, but a light nitrogen top dressing during the early vegetative stage can boost growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?moth-beans,disease" alt="Diseases in Moth Beans"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> This fungal disease causes white powdery spots on leaves, reducing photosynthesis. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and resistant varieties to control the spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Brown or black spots on leaves caused by fungal infections. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and practice crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> These small sap-sucking insects can weaken the plants. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use neem oil or insecticides to manage aphid infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?moth-beans,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate moth beans with other crops like cereals or legumes to reduce the buildup of soil-borne diseases and pests.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Control weeds, especially during the early stages of plant growth, to reduce competition for nutrients and moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy diseased plant debris to reduce the risk of disease outbreaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid over-irrigation, as moth beans prefer dry conditions and excess moisture can lead to root diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?moth-beans,care" alt="Care for Moth Beans"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Moth beans grow best in temperatures between 77-95°F (25-35°C) and are highly tolerant of heat and drought conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Moth beans require minimal irrigation. In rain-fed areas, they rely on monsoon rains, while supplemental irrigation may be needed in dry regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants about 12-18 inches apart in rows to ensure proper airflow and reduce the risk of disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests like aphids and caterpillars, and use organic or chemical insecticides as needed to manage infestations.</li>
