            <img src="Bajra.jpg" alt="Bajra Planting">
            <p>Bajra, also known as Pearl Millet, is a warm-season crop that thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The best seasons for growing Bajra are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Bajra is primarily sown in the summer season. It requires hot and dry conditions for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> In regions with reliable monsoon rainfall, Bajra can be planted with the onset of monsoons for a bountiful harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Monsoon:</strong> In areas with mild winters, Bajra can also be grown post-monsoon, provided there is adequate irrigation.</li>
            </ul>
