            <img src="Quinoa.webp" alt="Quinoa Planting">
            <p>Quinoa is a versatile crop that grows well in various climates, including temperate and subtropical regions. It can be grown in the following seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Ideal for planting in temperate climates, allowing the crop to mature during the warmer months.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> In regions with mild summers, quinoa can be planted early in the season for a summer harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Quinoa can also be grown as a late-season crop in regions with cooler autumns.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,quinoa" alt="Soil for Quinoa"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Quinoa prefers well-drained sandy loam or loamy soils with moderate organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH is between 6.0 and 8.0, and quinoa can tolerate slightly alkaline soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Add compost or organic matter to improve soil fertility before planting quinoa.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Quinoa</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,quinoa" alt="Fertilizer for Quinoa"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use well-decomposed manure or compost to improve soil structure and nutrient content.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen-Fixing:</strong> While quinoa doesn’t fix nitrogen, it benefits from balanced fertilizers low in nitrogen but high in phosphorus and potassium.</li>
                <li><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Ensure adequate levels of micronutrients like zinc and iron for optimal quinoa growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Quinoa</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?quinoa,disease" alt="Diseases in Quinoa"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease that causes yellow patches on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and fungicides when necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Results in dark spots on leaves, leading to early defoliation. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and practice crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Stem Rot:</strong> A soil-borne disease causing wilting and stem decay. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid over-irrigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Insect pests that suck plant sap, reducing growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use biological controls or insecticidal soap as needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?quinoa,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate quinoa with non-related crops to reduce pest and disease pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space plants appropriately to ensure air circulation and reduce fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and infected materials to limit the spread of disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Practices:</strong> Avoid overhead watering to minimize the risk of fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant quinoa varieties to lower susceptibility to pests and diseases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?quinoa,care" alt="Care for Quinoa"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Quinoa thrives in temperatures between 59-68°F (15-20°C) but can tolerate a wide range of climates.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> While quinoa is drought-tolerant, it should be watered regularly during seedling establishment.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Plant quinoa 12-18 inches apart to allow for proper air circulation and root development.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and leaf miners. Use organic or chemical control measures as required.</li>
