            <img src="Onion.jpg" alt="Onion Planting">
            <p>Onions are versatile crops grown in a variety of climates. Depending on the region and climate, onions can be grown in the following seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kharif Season:</strong> Onions are sown in monsoon (June-July) and harvested in October-November.</li>
                <li><strong>Rabi Season:</strong> The winter crop is sown in October-November and harvested in March-April.</li>
                <li><strong>Late Kharif Season:</strong> In some regions, onions can be sown in August-September and harvested in January-February.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,onions" alt="Soil for Onions"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Onions thrive in well-drained sandy loam, clay loam, or silt loam soils with good moisture retention.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for onions is between 6.0 and 7.5. They can tolerate slightly acidic to neutral soils.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Plow the soil deeply and incorporate organic matter like compost or farmyard manure to improve soil structure and fertility.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,onions" alt="Fertilizer for Onions"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Matter:</strong> Apply well-rotted farmyard manure or compost during soil preparation to boost organic content.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus and Potassium:</strong> Apply phosphorus-rich fertilizers such as superphosphate and potassium at the time of transplanting for better root and bulb development.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogenous Fertilizers:</strong> Top-dress with nitrogen fertilizers during the early stages of growth to promote healthy foliage and bulb formation.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease causing yellowing and wilting of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and avoid waterlogging in the field.</li>
                <li><strong>Basal Rot:</strong> A soil-borne disease that causes rotting of the onion bulb. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Practice crop rotation and avoid overwatering.</li>
                <li><strong>Onion Thrips:</strong> Small insects that feed on onion leaves, causing white streaks and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticides or neem-based sprays to manage thrip infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?onion,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate onions with non-allium crops like cereals or legumes to reduce the buildup of soil-borne diseases and pests.</li>
                <li><strong>Weed Control:</strong> Keep the field free of weeds during the early stages of growth to ensure healthy bulb development.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy diseased plant debris to minimize disease spread in subsequent crops.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Onions require adequate but controlled watering. Avoid over-irrigation, which can lead to fungal diseases like rot.</li>
                <li><strong>Mulching:</strong> Use mulch to conserve soil moisture and control weeds, especially in hot climates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <!-- <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?onion,care" alt="Care for Onions"> -->
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Onions grow best in temperatures ranging from 60-75°F (15-24°C), with a preference for cooler weather during the initial growth stages and warmer conditions for bulb development.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Onions need consistent moisture, especially during bulb formation. Irrigation should be carefully managed to avoid water stress or waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 4-6 inches apart in rows to ensure proper bulb development and reduce the risk of disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as onion thrips, maggots, and aphids. Use organic or chemical insecticides as necessary to manage infestations.</li>
