            <h2>1. What is Rubber?</h2>
            <p>Rubber is a natural elastic material obtained from the sap of the rubber tree (*Hevea brasiliensis*). It is widely used in various industries, including automotive, manufacturing, and consumer goods, due to its flexibility, durability, and waterproof properties.</p>

        <div class="section" id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of Rubber</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> The rubber tree can grow up to 100 feet tall with a straight trunk. The bark is smooth and produces a milky latex when tapped.</li>
                <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Natural rubber has a soft, elastic texture, making it suitable for various applications, from tires to footwear.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Rubber does not have nutritional value but is important for its economic significance and uses in products.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Rubber</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Rubber trees thrive in tropical climates with temperatures between 68째F and 95째F (20째C to 35째C) and high humidity. They require well-distributed rainfall throughout the year.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Rubber prefers deep, well-drained soils rich in organic matter. The ideal soil pH is between 4.5 and 6.5.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Rubber trees are typically planted in well-prepared fields at a spacing of 10 to 12 feet apart. Seedlings are usually planted in the rainy season for better establishment.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Rubber</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Young rubber trees require regular watering to establish their root systems, especially during dry spells. Mature trees are more drought-tolerant.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply balanced fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to promote healthy growth. Regular soil testing can guide fertilization needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Common pests include leaf-cutting ants and caterpillars. Integrated pest management and organic pesticides can help control infestations.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Rubber trees can be affected by diseases such as leaf blight and root rot. Proper management practices, including crop rotation and sanitation, can help mitigate these issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Rubber</h2>
            <p>Rubber tapping typically begins 5-7 years after planting when the trees are mature. The latex is harvested by making a shallow cut in the bark, allowing the sap to flow into collection cups. This process is usually done in the early morning to maximize latex yield.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Rubber</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Rubber is primarily used in the production of tires, footwear, and industrial products.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer Goods:</strong> It is also used to make various consumer items such as gloves, belts, and household goods.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Applications:</strong> Natural rubber latex is used in medical supplies like gloves and catheters due to its flexibility and durability.</li>
