            <h2>2. Characteristics of Barley</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Barley grains are small, oblong, and come in colors ranging from pale yellow to reddish-brown.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth Habit:</strong> Barley is a hardy crop, growing in both warm and cool climates. It matures quickly, making it ideal for crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Barley is rich in dietary fiber, vitamins B and E, and minerals like magnesium and phosphorus.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Barley</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Barley thrives in temperate climates with temperatures between 55째F and 75째F (13째C to 24째C).</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> It grows best in well-drained, fertile soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.5, but it can tolerate poor soil conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Barley can be sown directly in the field either in the spring or fall. For spring barley, plant in early spring; for winter barley, plant in the fall.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Barley</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Barley is drought-tolerant but needs adequate moisture during early growth stages. Avoid overwatering, as it can lead to fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply nitrogen-based fertilizers before planting and again at the tillering stage for optimum growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids and armyworms. Use integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, including crop rotation and natural predators.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Barley</h2>
            <p>Barley is ready for harvest when the grain is firm and the plant turns golden. Harvest usually occurs 70-90 days after planting. Use a combine harvester to thresh the grains, and ensure proper drying to prevent spoilage.</p>
