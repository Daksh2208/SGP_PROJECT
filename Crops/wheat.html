            <h2>1. What is Wheat?</h2>
            <p>Wheat (*Triticum spp.*) is a cereal grain that is a staple food for a large portion of the world's population. It is primarily grown for its seeds, which are milled into flour and used in various food products, including bread, pasta, and pastries.</p>

        <div class="section" id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of Wheat</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Wheat plants typically grow 2-4 feet tall, with slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The grain heads contain small, hard seeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Varieties:</strong> Common types include hard red, soft red, hard white, soft white, and durum wheat, each suited for different uses.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Wheat is rich in carbohydrates, fiber, and essential nutrients, including B vitamins and minerals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Cultivation of Wheat</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Wheat grows best in temperate climates, with a temperature range of 60째F to 75째F (15째C to 24째C).</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Prefers well-drained, loamy soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0 and good organic matter content.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow seeds directly in the soil during the fall (winter wheat) or spring (spring wheat). Seeds should be planted 1-2 inches deep, spaced 6-8 inches apart.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Wheat</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Wheat requires moderate watering, especially during the grain filling stage. Avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium based on soil tests to promote healthy growth and yield.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and armyworms. Use integrated pest management (IPM) techniques to control outbreaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Common diseases include leaf rust and Fusarium head blight. Crop rotation and resistant varieties can help minimize risks.</li>
            </ul>
