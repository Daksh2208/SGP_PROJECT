                <h3>Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong>Cotton thrives in warm climates. Ideal temperatures for growth
                        range from 25째C to 35째C (77째F to 95째F). It is sensitive to frost and cannot tolerate prolonged
                        cold periods. </li>
                    <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Cotton requires full sunlight for optimal growth. It is a
                        photoperiod-sensitive plant, meaning the amount of daylight affects its flowering and fruiting
                        cycles.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="season">
                <h3>Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> A long frost-free period, typically 150-200 days, is necessary
                        for cotton to fully mature.</li>

                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong>Cotton grows best in deep, well-drained loamy soils rich in organic
                        matter. Sandy loam and clayey loam are preferable for good root development.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal pH level for cotton is between 6.0 and 7.5. Cotton can
                        tolerate slightly acidic to neutral soil.</li>\
                    <li><strong>Fertility:</strong>Cotton requires soils with a balanced nutrient profile, particularly
                        in nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus.</li>

                <h3>Types of Fertilizers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong>Organic fertilization involves the use of natural materials
                        to provide nutrients to cotton crops. Common organic fertilizers include compost, manure, cover
                        crops, and bone meal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inorganic Fertilizers:</strong> Inorganic fertilization involves the use of synthetic or
                        chemically processed fertilizers, such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)
                        compounds.</li>

            </article>
            <article id="schedule">
                <h3>Fertilization Schedule</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Early Spring:</strong> Early spring or as per regional climate (March-April in many
                        regions).</li>
                    <li><strong>Mid Summer:</strong> Use a high-phosphorus fertilizer to encourage blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Reduce fertilization as the growing season ends.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seeds:</strong>Cotton seeds typically germinate within 5 to 10 days, depending on soil
                        temperature and moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moisture:</strong> Ensure the soil is moist but not saturated at the time of planting.
                        Proper soil moisture is essential for seed germination and early seedling growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="Weed Control">
                <h3>Weed Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pre-Emergence Herbicides:</strong> Applying herbicides before planting or just after
                        planting can help control early weed competition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultivation:</strong> Mechanical cultivation may be necessary to control weeds in early
                        growth stages before the cotton canopy closes.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Yellowing and wilting of leaves, stunted growth, vascular
                        discoloration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conditions:</strong>Warm temperatures, dry conditions, and poor soil drainage. </li>
                    <li><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties.
                        Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., corn, soybeans).
                        Improve soil drainage.</li>

                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Stunted plants, gall formation on roots, poor growth, and yield loss.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties or nematode-tolerant rootstocks.
                        Practice crop rotation.
                        Apply nematicides if nematode pressure is high.</li>

                <h3>Spider Mites</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Mites suck sap from leaves, causing yellowing, speckling, and
                        eventual leaf drop, particularly under hot, dry conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Control</strong> Maintain good field hygiene and control dust.
                        Use miticides when mite populations reach damaging levels.
                        Conserve natural predators like predatory mites.</li>

                <h3>Whiteflies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Whiteflies feed on cotton sap, causing yellowing of leaves and
                        producing honeydew, which leads to sooty mold. They can also transmit viral diseases.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Control:</strong> Introduce natural enemies like parasitic wasps.
                        Apply insecticides based on population monitoring.
                        Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides that may kill beneficial predators.</li>

            <h2>Harvesting and Post-Harvest Care</h2>
            <article id="harvesting">
                <h3>Harvesting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong>Cotton is ready for harvest when most bolls have fully opened, and the
                        lint is fluffy. This usually occurs 140 to 160 days after planting, depending on the variety and
                        climate.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Cotton pickers use spindles to twist the cotton lint off the bolls,
                        leaving the plant intact. This method is less destructive to the plants and can harvest the
                        cotton in multiple passes.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="post-harvest-care">
                <h3>Post-Harvest Care</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ginning:</strong> Cotton is taken to a gin after harvest to separate the seeds from the lint. The ginning process should begin soon after harvesting to avoid lint degradation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong>  Harvested cotton should be kept dry to prevent microbial growth and fiber degradation. Store cotton modules in areas protected from rain and moisture.</li>
                </ul>
