            <h2>1. What is Sunflower?</h2>
            <p>Sunflower (*Helianthus annuus*) is a tall, annual plant known for its large, bright yellow flowers and edible seeds. It is primarily grown for its oil-rich seeds, which are used for cooking oil, snacks, and other products. Sunflowers also serve as ornamental plants and in crop rotation to improve soil health.</p>

        <div class="section" id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of Sunflower</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Sunflowers are tall, sturdy plants that can grow between 3 to 12 feet tall, with large, bright yellow flower heads that follow the sun throughout the day (a behavior known as heliotropism). The flower head contains hundreds of seeds at its center, which are either black or striped.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The seeds have a mild, nutty flavor and are often roasted and eaten as snacks or pressed to extract oil.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Sunflower seeds are high in healthy fats, particularly unsaturated fats, and contain vitamin E, magnesium, and selenium.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Sunflower</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Sunflowers grow best in sunny, warm climates with temperatures between 70째F and 78째F (21째C to 26째C). They are drought-tolerant once established, but they thrive with regular moisture during the growing season.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Sunflowers prefer well-drained soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. They can grow in a wide range of soil types, but loamy or sandy soils enriched with organic matter are ideal for optimal growth and yield.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sunflower seeds can be sown directly in the garden after the last frost. Plant seeds 1-1.5 inches deep, with spacing of 6-12 inches between plants in rows that are about 30 inches apart. For large-scale farming, mechanical planters are commonly used.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Sunflower</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> While sunflowers are drought-tolerant, they require consistent moisture during germination and early growth. Once established, water deeply once a week, particularly during dry spells, but avoid overwatering as it can cause root rot.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Sunflowers benefit from a balanced fertilizer at planting. Use a nitrogen-rich fertilizer during the early growth stage, then switch to a phosphorus and potassium-rich fertilizer during flowering to promote seed development.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Common pests include aphids, cutworms, and sunflower moths. Use organic or chemical pest control methods as needed. Bird nets or scare tactics may also be necessary to protect seeds from birds during ripening.</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Tall sunflower varieties may require staking or support, especially in windy areas, to prevent the stems from breaking under the weight of the large flower heads.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Sunflower</h2>
            <p>Sunflowers are ready to harvest when the back of the flower head turns yellow or brown, and the seeds are plump and hard. Cut the flower heads with about 1 foot of stem attached and hang them upside down in a dry, well-ventilated area to dry. Once dry, seeds can be removed by rubbing the head or shaking it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Sunflower</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oil Production:</strong> Sunflower seeds are primarily grown for oil extraction. Sunflower oil is used for cooking and in processed food products.</li>
                <li><strong>Snacks:</strong> The seeds are often roasted and eaten as a healthy snack or used in granola, trail mixes, and salads.</li>
                <li><strong>Animal Feed:</strong> Sunflower seeds and meal are used as a high-protein feed for livestock and poultry.</li>
                <li><strong>Ornamental:</strong> Sunflowers are also grown as ornamental plants for landscaping and floral arrangements.</li>
