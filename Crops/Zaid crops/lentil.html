            <h2>2. Characteristics of Lentils</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Lentils come in various colors including green, brown, red, and black. They are typically small, flat, and round, with a slightly bumpy surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Lentils have a mild, earthy flavor that pairs well with a variety of seasonings and ingredients, making them versatile in cooking.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Lentils are an excellent source of protein, dietary fiber, folate, iron, and various antioxidants, contributing to a healthy diet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Cultivation of Lentils</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Lentils thrive in cool, dry climates. They prefer temperatures between 60°F and 70°F (15°C to 21°C) and are sensitive to frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Lentils grow best in well-drained, loamy soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Soils rich in organic matter can enhance growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Lentils are usually sown in early spring, after the last frost. Seeds should be planted about 1-2 inches deep and spaced 1-2 inches apart.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Lentils</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Lentils require moderate watering, especially during the flowering stage. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Lentils generally require less fertilizer compared to other crops. A light application of nitrogen or phosphorus can be beneficial, particularly before flowering.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Common pests include aphids and weevils. Use organic pest control methods, such as insecticidal soap, and practice crop rotation to manage infestations.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Lentils are susceptible to fungal diseases like root rot. Ensure proper spacing for airflow and avoid excessive moisture to minimize disease risk.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Lentils</h2>
            <p>Lentils are ready for harvest when the pods turn brown and the seeds inside are hard. This typically occurs 80-110 days after planting. Cut the plants at the base, and allow them to dry in a warm, sheltered area before threshing the seeds.</p>
        </div>
