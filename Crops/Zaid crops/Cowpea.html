            <h2>1. What is Cowpea?</h2>
            <p>Cowpea (*Vigna unguiculata*), also known as black-eyed peas or southern peas, is a legume widely cultivated for its edible seeds and pods. It is a drought-tolerant crop, making it ideal for arid and semi-arid regions.</p>

            <h2>2. Characteristics of Cowpea</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Cowpea plants are bushy, typically 1-2 feet tall, with green or purple stems. The seeds are oval with a distinctive black "eye" at the center.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Cowpea seeds have a mild, nutty flavor and are used in various dishes, while the tender pods can be consumed like green beans.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Cowpeas are rich in protein, fiber, vitamins A and C, and essential minerals like calcium and iron.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Cultivation of Cowpea</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Cowpea thrives in warm climates with temperatures ranging between 65째F and 85째F (18째C to 29째C). It is highly drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dry regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> It prefers well-drained, loamy soil with a pH of 5.5 to 6.5. Sandy soils are also suitable for cowpea cultivation.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow seeds directly in the garden after the last frost, 1-2 inches deep, or start them indoors and transplant after 2-3 weeks.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Cowpea</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> While cowpeas are drought-tolerant, they need adequate moisture during flowering and pod formation. Water deeply but allow the soil to dry out between waterings.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Cowpeas require minimal fertilization as they fix nitrogen in the soil. However, a light application of phosphorus and potassium can help promote growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids, weevils, and pod borers. Organic methods like neem oil or insecticidal soap can be used to manage infestations.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Cowpea</h2>
            <p>Cowpeas can be harvested as tender pods for fresh use or left to mature and dry for seeds. Fresh pods can be harvested 60-70 days after planting. For dry seeds, allow the pods to dry on the plant and then collect and shell them.</p>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Cowpea</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Culinary:</strong> Cowpea seeds can be cooked in soups, stews, and curries, while the fresh pods can be stir-fried or added to salads. It is a staple food in many African, Asian, and Southern U.S. cuisines.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Improvement:</strong> Cowpeas fix nitrogen in the soil, making them valuable as a cover crop or for crop rotation to enhance soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Animal Feed:</strong> The leaves and stems of cowpea plants can be used as livestock fodder.</li>
