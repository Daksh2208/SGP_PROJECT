            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Mint plants are typically 12-18 inches tall, with green, serrated leaves and purple or white flowers. They spread quickly and can take over garden spaces if not managed.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor and Aroma:</strong> Mint has a fresh, cooling flavor and a strong, pleasant aroma, which makes it popular in culinary and medicinal uses.</li>
                <li><strong>Uses:</strong> Mint is used for flavoring teas, desserts, salads, and sauces. It also has medicinal properties, including soothing digestive issues and relieving headaches.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Cultivation of Mint</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Mint thrives in temperate climates with plenty of sunlight, although it can tolerate partial shade. Ideal temperatures for mint growth are between 55°F and 70°F (13°C to 21°C).</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Mint prefers rich, well-drained soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Adding organic compost improves soil fertility and supports healthy growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Mint can be grown from seeds, cuttings, or root divisions. It’s often best to plant mint in containers to prevent it from spreading uncontrollably in the garden. Plant outdoors in spring after the last frost or start indoors.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Mint</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Mint requires regular watering to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Proper moisture encourages lush foliage, which is key to a healthy mint crop.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Mint benefits from organic matter and balanced fertilizers. A light application of compost or slow-release fertilizer in spring can boost growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Mint is relatively resistant to pests, though it may sometimes be affected by aphids, spider mites, or rust. Regular monitoring and using organic pest control methods will keep these issues at bay.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Mint can be prone to fungal infections like rust and powdery mildew. Good air circulation and avoiding overwatering help prevent these problems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Harvesting Mint</h2>

Regular harvesting encourages more growth, so don't hesitate to pick the leaves frequently! Cut mint leaves in the morning for the best flavor, and use scissors to snip stems just above a leaf node.</p>
