            <h2>1. What is Berseem?</h2>
            <p>Berseem (*Trifolium alexandrinum*), also known as Egyptian clover, is a leguminous forage crop commonly grown for its high nutritional value. It is primarily used as livestock feed, improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</p>

        <div class="section" id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of Berseem</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Berseem is a lush, green plant that grows about 1-2 feet tall, with trifoliate leaves and clusters of small white or purple flowers.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The leaves have a mild, sweet flavor, making them palatable for livestock.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Berseem is high in protein, fiber, and minerals, making it an excellent forage option for dairy and beef cattle.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Berseem</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Berseem thrives in warm climates, with an ideal temperature range of 65째F to 80째F (18째C to 27째C).</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> It prefers well-drained, fertile soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.5. Sandy loam soils are particularly suitable.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow seeds directly in the soil after the last frost, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep, with a seed rate of 15-20 kg per hectare.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Berseem</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Berseem requires regular watering, especially during dry spells. Ensure the soil remains consistently moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, to promote healthy growth and yield. Side-dressing during growth can enhance productivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and leafhoppers. Use organic pest management strategies to control infestations.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Diseases like downy mildew can occur; practice crop rotation and use disease-resistant varieties when possible.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Berseem</h2>
            <p>Harvest berseem when it reaches a height of about 12-18 inches, usually 60-90 days after planting. Use a sickle or mower to cut the plants at the base, allowing for regrowth for multiple cuttings.</p>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Berseem</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forage:</strong> Berseem is primarily used as high-quality forage for livestock, particularly in dairy and beef production.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Improvement:</strong> As a legume, berseem fixes atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil and enhancing fertility for subsequent crops.</li>
                <li><strong>Cover Crop:</strong> It can be used as a cover crop to prevent soil erosion and improve soil structure during off-seasons.</li>
