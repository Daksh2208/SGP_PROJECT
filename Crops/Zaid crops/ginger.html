            <h2>1. What is Ginger?</h2>
            <p>Ginger (*Zingiber officinale*) is a tropical flowering plant known for its rhizome (underground stem), which is widely used as a spice and for its medicinal properties. It has been a staple in traditional medicines and culinary dishes worldwide for centuries.</p>

            <h2>2. Characteristics of Ginger</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Ginger plants grow to about 3 feet tall with narrow green leaves. The rhizomes are the edible parts and have a thick, knobby appearance with a light brown outer skin and yellowish flesh.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Ginger has a pungent, spicy, and slightly sweet flavor, often used in cooking, beverages, and herbal remedies.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Ginger contains bioactive compounds like gingerol, which have powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. It is also rich in vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, magnesium, and potassium.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Ginger</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Ginger thrives in warm, humid climates, with ideal temperatures between 68째F and 86째F (20째C to 30째C). It requires a long, frost-free growing season and partial shade.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Ginger grows best in loose, loamy, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. The soil pH should range from 5.5 to 6.5. Mulching with organic material helps maintain soil moisture and temperature.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Ginger is typically propagated using rhizomes (seed pieces). Cut rhizomes into 1-2 inch pieces with at least one bud and plant them in well-prepared soil about 2-4 inches deep. Planting is usually done at the beginning of the rainy season.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Ginger</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Ginger requires consistent moisture, particularly during the growing season. Water regularly but avoid waterlogging, which can lead to rhizome rot. Irrigate the plants during dry spells to maintain optimal moisture levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply well-rotted compost or manure during planting. Ginger benefits from additional fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium during the growing season.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Common pests include root-knot nematodes, aphids, and leafhoppers. Use organic pesticides and rotate crops to prevent pest infestations. Proper soil drainage can help prevent fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Ginger is prone to fungal diseases like rhizome rot and bacterial wilt. Ensure proper drainage, avoid waterlogging, and remove affected plants to prevent the spread of diseases.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Ginger</h2>
            <p>Ginger is ready for harvest 8-10 months after planting when the leaves start to yellow and die back. Early harvest (after 5-6 months) yields immature ginger with a milder flavor. To harvest, dig up the entire plant, gently remove the rhizomes, and wash them thoroughly. Store in a cool, dry place.</p>
