            <h2>1. What is Pumpkin?</h2>

            <h2>2. Characteristics of Pumpkin</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Pumpkins are large, round, and orange, but they can also come in other colors like yellow, white, or green depending on the variety. The rind is thick, and the flesh inside is dense.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The flesh has a mildly sweet flavor, making it suitable for both sweet and savory dishes.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Pumpkins are rich in vitamins A and C, fiber, and antioxidants. They are low in calories and high in nutrients, making them an excellent choice for a healthy diet.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Pumpkin</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Pumpkins thrive in warm, sunny climates with temperatures ranging from 65째F to 85째F (18째C to 29째C). They require a long growing season, typically 90-120 days, and are sensitive to frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Pumpkins grow best in well-drained, loamy soil that is rich in organic matter. The ideal soil pH is between 6.0 and 6.8.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow seeds directly into the garden after the last frost, spacing seeds about 2-3 feet apart in rows that are 6-8 feet apart. Alternatively, start seeds indoors and transplant them after the soil has warmed up.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Pumpkin</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Pumpkins require consistent moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development. Water deeply, focusing on the base of the plant to avoid wetting the leaves, which can lead to fungal diseases. Ensure the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer when planting, and side-dress with a nitrogen-rich fertilizer when the vines start to spread. Potassium is also important for fruit development.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like squash bugs, aphids, and vine borers. Use organic methods like neem oil or hand-picking to control pests. Mulching can help keep the soil moist and control weeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Pumpkins are sprawling plants and can take up a lot of space. Train vines to grow in one direction or prune excess vines to conserve space.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Pumpkin</h2>
            <p>Pumpkins are ready to harvest when they are fully colored, the skin is hard, and they make a hollow sound when tapped. Typically, this is 90-120 days after planting. Cut the pumpkin from the vine, leaving a few inches of the stem attached, and cure them in a warm, dry place for about 10 days to extend shelf life.</p>
