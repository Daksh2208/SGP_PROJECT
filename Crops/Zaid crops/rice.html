            <h2>1. What is Rice?</h2>
            <p>Rice (*Oryza sativa*) is a cereal grain that is a staple food for over half of the world's population. It is a versatile crop grown in various climates, known for its high carbohydrate content and nutritional value. Rice can be categorized into two main types: indica and japonica.</p>

            <h2>2. Characteristics of Rice</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Rice plants typically grow 3-4 feet tall, with long, narrow leaves. The grains are oval and can vary in color from white to brown, red, or black.</li>
                <li><strong>Varieties:</strong> Common varieties include long-grain, medium-grain, and short-grain rice, each with distinct textures and cooking qualities.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Rice is rich in carbohydrates, provides energy, and contains essential nutrients, including B vitamins, iron, and magnesium.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Rice</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Rice requires a warm climate with temperatures between 70째F and 100째F (21째C to 38째C) for optimal growth. It is sensitive to frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Rice prefers well-drained, fertile soil with a pH of 5.5 to 7.0. Heavy clay soils retain water well and are ideal for rice cultivation.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Rice is typically grown in flooded fields called paddies, which help control weeds and pests. Proper water management is crucial during all growth stages.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Rice can be sown directly in fields or transplanted as seedlings. If direct sowing, plant seeds 1-2 inches deep. For transplanting, seedlings should be 3-4 weeks old and spaced 6-12 inches apart.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Rice</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Maintain a water depth of 4-8 inches in paddies. Regularly monitor water levels to ensure proper irrigation, especially during dry spells.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers based on soil tests. Fertilization is typically done before planting and again during tillering.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Common pests include rice weevils and stem borers. Use integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, including crop rotation and biological controls.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Rice is susceptible to diseases such as blast and bacterial blight. Use resistant varieties and practice good sanitation to minimize disease incidence.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Rice</h2>
            <p>Rice is ready for harvest when the grains turn golden brown, typically 3-6 months after planting, depending on the variety and conditions. Use a sickle or combine harvester to cut the rice stalks, and ensure the grains are properly dried to prevent spoilage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Rice</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Culinary:</strong> Rice is a staple food in many cultures, used in a variety of dishes, including pilafs, risottos, sushi, and rice pudding.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Rice is gluten-free and easily digestible, making it suitable for those with dietary restrictions. Brown rice, in particular, is rich in fiber and essential nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Uses:</strong> Rice husks can be used for biofuel, animal bedding, and in the production of building materials and biodegradable plastics.</li>
