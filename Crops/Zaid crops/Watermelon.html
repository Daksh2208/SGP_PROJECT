            <h2>1. What is Watermelon?</h2>
            <p>Watermelon (*Citrullus lanatus*) is a vine-like flowering plant from the Cucurbitaceae family. It produces a large, round fruit with a hard, green rind and sweet, juicy red or pink flesh filled with seeds. It is popular for its high water content and refreshing taste, especially during summer.</p>

            <h2>2. Characteristics of Watermelon</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Watermelon fruits are typically round or oval-shaped with a green rind that may have stripes or spots. Inside, the flesh is red or pink, though some varieties have yellow flesh.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The flesh is sweet and juicy, with a high water content, making it a refreshing fruit.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Watermelons are low in calories and high in vitamins A and C. They are also a good source of antioxidants, particularly lycopene, which has numerous health benefits.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>3. Cultivation of Watermelon</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Watermelons thrive in warm climates with temperatures between 70째F and 90째F (21째C to 32째C). They are sensitive to frost and need a long, hot growing season to produce well.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Watermelons prefer well-drained, sandy loam soil with plenty of organic matter. The ideal pH range is between 6.0 and 7.5. Good soil drainage is essential to prevent root rot.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow seeds directly into the garden after the last frost, spacing seeds about 3-5 feet apart in rows 6-10 feet apart. Watermelons need a lot of space for their sprawling vines. For an early start, seeds can be planted indoors and then transplanted when the soil has warmed up.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Watermelon</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Watermelons require regular watering, especially during the fruiting stage. Ensure the soil stays consistently moist but avoid waterlogging. Deep watering encourages deep root growth. Water in the morning to reduce the risk of diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer when planting and side-dress with nitrogen when the vines begin to run. Use a potassium-rich fertilizer to improve fruit size and sweetness during fruit development.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Common pests include aphids, cucumber beetles, and squash bugs. Use organic pest control methods like neem oil or insecticidal soap. Mulching can help control weeds and conserve moisture.</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> While watermelons are typically grown on the ground, smaller varieties can be grown on trellises with proper support for the fruit to prevent breaking from the vine.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Watermelon</h2>
            <p>Watermelons are typically ready to harvest 80-100 days after planting. Signs of ripeness include a dull sound when tapped, the tendrils near the fruit turning brown, and the underside of the fruit (where it touches the ground) turning yellow. Harvest watermelons by cutting them from the vine with a sharp knife.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Watermelon</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Culinary:</strong> Watermelon is commonly eaten fresh, either on its own or in fruit salads. It can also be blended into smoothies, juices, or desserts. The seeds can be roasted for a healthy snack.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Due to its high water content, watermelon is hydrating and helps maintain electrolyte balance. Its antioxidant properties, particularly from lycopene, support heart health and may reduce inflammation.</li>
