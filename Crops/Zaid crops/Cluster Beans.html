            <h2>1. What are Cluster Beans?</h2>
            <p>Cluster beans, also known as guar (*Cyamopsis tetragonoloba*), are legumes commonly grown in arid and semi-arid regions. They are valued for their edible green pods and are also used as a source of guar gum, a thickening agent in the food industry.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> The plant grows about 2-3 feet tall, with slender, green pods that grow in clusters. The pods are typically 4-6 inches long.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Cluster beans have a slightly bitter flavor, often described as earthy, making them suitable for various dishes.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> They are low in calories and high in fiber, vitamins A and C, and minerals such as calcium and iron.</li>

            <h2>3. Cultivation of Cluster Beans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Cluster beans thrive in warm climates, preferring temperatures between 70째F and 90째F (21째C to 32째C). They are drought-tolerant and well-suited for dry regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> They prefer well-drained sandy or loamy soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.5.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow seeds directly in the garden after the last frost, about 1-2 inches deep, or start them indoors and transplant after 3-4 weeks.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Cluster Beans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> While cluster beans are drought-tolerant, consistent moisture is essential during germination and flowering. Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> They require low to moderate fertility. A balanced fertilizer can be applied during planting, but excessive nitrogen should be avoided to encourage pod production.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic pest control methods, such as neem oil or insecticidal soap, as needed.</li>
            </ul>
