            <h2>2. Characteristics of Muskmelon</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Muskmelon has a netted, rough rind with orange or green flesh inside. The fruit is typically round or oval in shape and ranges in size.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The flesh is sweet, juicy, and aromatic, often eaten fresh or in salads.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Muskmelon is low in calories and rich in vitamins A and C, potassium, and dietary fiber. It is also highly hydrating.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Muskmelon</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Muskmelon thrives in warm, sunny climates. It prefers temperatures between 70째F and 90째F (21째C to 32째C). It is highly sensitive to frost and requires a long, warm growing season.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Muskmelon prefers well-drained, sandy loam or loamy soil rich in organic matter, with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow muskmelon seeds directly in the garden after the last frost, spacing seeds about 18-24 inches apart in rows that are 4-6 feet apart. Alternatively, start seeds indoors and transplant them after the soil has warmed up.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Muskmelon</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Muskmelons require consistent moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development. Water deeply at the base of the plant, avoiding wetting the leaves to reduce the risk of fungal diseases. Reduce watering as the fruits ripen to enhance sweetness.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer at planting. When the vines begin to run, side-dress with a nitrogen-rich fertilizer to promote healthy growth and fruit development.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests such as aphids, cucumber beetles, and vine borers. Use organic pest control methods like neem oil or insecticidal soap as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Muskmelons can be grown on the ground or trained to climb trellises. If trellising, use supports for the fruits to prevent them from breaking off as they grow heavier.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Muskmelon</h2>
            <p>Muskmelons are typically ready to harvest 70-90 days after planting, when the fruit develops a strong aroma, the rind turns slightly yellow, and the stem begins to separate easily from the fruit. Harvest them by gently twisting or cutting the fruit from the vine.</p>
