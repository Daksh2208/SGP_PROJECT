            <h2>1. What is Dhaincha?</h2>
            <p>Dhaincha (*Sesbania bispinosa*) is a leguminous green manure crop commonly used in India to improve soil fertility. It is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which helps enrich the soil for subsequent crops.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="characteristics">
            <h2>2. Characteristics of Dhaincha</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Dhaincha is a fast-growing herbaceous plant that can grow up to 6-8 feet tall. It has long, slender stems with small green leaves and yellow flowers.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Enrichment:</strong> Dhaincha is used to add nitrogen to the soil through its nitrogen-fixing root nodules, making it an excellent green manure crop for restoring soil health.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth Habit:</strong> It grows well in waterlogged, saline, and alkaline soils and is often used to reclaim fallow or degraded lands.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Dhaincha</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Dhaincha thrives in warm and humid climates. It is highly tolerant of waterlogged soils and can survive in areas with poor drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Dhaincha prefers well-drained loamy or sandy soil but can also grow in saline or alkaline conditions. It improves soil texture and fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow seeds directly in the field during the early rainy season (April-June). Broadcast seeds or sow them in rows, spacing them 6-8 inches apart.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Dhaincha</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Dhaincha requires minimal care once established. It tolerates waterlogged conditions but will benefit from regular irrigation in dry areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> No chemical fertilizers are required, as Dhaincha fixes its own nitrogen through its root nodules. Incorporating the plant into the soil before flowering maximizes nitrogen content.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Dhaincha is generally pest-resistant, but occasional monitoring for insect infestations or fungal diseases like leaf spot is advised. Use organic pest control methods if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting and Incorporation</h2>
            <p>Harvest Dhaincha by cutting the plants down just before they begin to flower, around 6-8 weeks after sowing. Incorporate the green biomass into the soil to decompose, improving soil fertility for the next crop cycle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="uses">
            <h2>6. Uses of Dhaincha</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Green Manure:</strong> Dhaincha is primarily used as a green manure crop. Its incorporation into the soil increases organic matter and enhances soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Improvement:</strong> It helps in reclaiming saline and alkaline soils, making it useful for degraded lands.</li>
                <li><strong>Animal Feed:</strong> The green foliage of Dhaincha can also be used as fodder for livestock.</li>
            </ul>
