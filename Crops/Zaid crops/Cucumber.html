            <h2>2. Characteristics of Cucumber</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Cucumber is a long, cylindrical fruit with smooth or slightly bumpy skin that ranges in color from light green to dark green.</li>
                <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> It has a mild, crisp, and watery flavor, making it a popular choice for salads and cooling dishes.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Cucumbers are low in calories and high in water content. They are a good source of vitamins K and C, as well as potassium.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultivation">
            <h2>3. Cultivation of Cucumber</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Cucumbers thrive in warm climates, preferring temperatures between 65째F and 95째F (18째C to 35째C). They are sensitive to frost and need full sun.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Cucumbers grow best in well-drained, loamy soil that is rich in organic matter. The soil pH should range from 6.0 to 7.0.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow cucumber seeds directly into the garden after the last frost or start them indoors and transplant them when the soil has warmed up. Space seeds about 12-18 inches apart in rows that are 3-4 feet apart.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Cucumber</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Cucumbers require consistent moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development. Water deeply at the base of the plant and avoid wetting the leaves to prevent fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer or compost at planting and side-dress with nitrogen when the plants start to flower.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as cucumber beetles, aphids, and spider mites. Use organic pest control methods, like neem oil or insecticidal soap, as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Cucumbers can be grown on the ground or trained on trellises to save space and improve air circulation, reducing disease risk.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Cucumber</h2>
            <p>Cucumbers are typically ready to harvest 50-70 days after planting. Pick them when they are firm, and before they over-mature, usually at about 6-8 inches long. Regular harvesting encourages more fruit production. Use a sharp knife or scissors to cut the cucumber from the vine.</p>
        </div>
