            <h2>1. What are Peas?</h2>
            <p>Peas (*Pisum sativum*) are a cool-season leguminous crop grown for their edible seeds. They are a popular vegetable known for their sweet flavor and are rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals. Peas can be categorized into several types, including garden peas, snap peas, and snow peas.</p>

            <h2>2. Characteristics of Peas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Pea plants typically grow 1-3 feet tall and have tendrils that help them climb. The leaves are compound and the flowers are usually white or purple.</li>
                <li><strong>Varieties:</strong> Common varieties include shelling peas (for fresh eating or freezing), snap peas (edible pods), and snow peas (flat, edible pods).</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Peas are an excellent source of plant-based protein, dietary fiber, vitamins A, C, and K, and various minerals, making them a healthy addition to any diet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Cultivation of Peas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Peas thrive in cool weather and are best planted in early spring or late summer. Ideal temperatures for growth range from 55째F to 75째F (13째C to 24째C).</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Peas prefer well-drained, loamy soil enriched with organic matter. A soil pH of 6.0 to 7.5 is optimal for their growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Sow seeds 1-2 inches deep and about 2 inches apart in rows spaced 18-24 inches apart. For a continuous harvest, plant successive batches every few weeks until early summer.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>4. Care for Peas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Peas need consistent moisture, especially during flowering and pod development. Water regularly, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Peas generally do not require much fertilization due to their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. A balanced fertilizer can be applied at planting if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Common pests include aphids, pea weevils, and spider mites. Use row covers to protect young plants and implement integrated pest management strategies as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Peas can be affected by diseases like powdery mildew and root rot. Crop rotation, proper spacing, and disease-resistant varieties can help mitigate these issues.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="harvesting">
            <h2>5. Harvesting Peas</h2>
            <p>Peas are ready to harvest when the pods are firm and the peas inside are plump, usually 60-70 days after planting. For shelling peas, pick pods that are bright green and firm. For snap and snow peas, harvest when the pods are still tender, before the peas inside fully mature. Use scissors or snips to avoid damaging the plant.</p>
        </div>

                <li><strong>Culinary:</strong> Peas are used in a variety of dishes, including soups, salads, and stir-fries. They can be eaten fresh, frozen, or canned.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Rich in nutrients, peas are known to support heart health, aid digestion, and contribute to weight management due to their high fiber content.</li>
