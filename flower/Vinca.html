            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Vinca thrives in temperatures between 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They are tolerant of both heat and cold but should be protected from frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Vinca plants prefer full sun to partial shade. They need at least 4-6 hours of sunlight per day to promote vigorous flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity is ideal for Vinca. They can adapt to varying levels of humidity but may require extra moisture in very dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation helps prevent fungal diseases and supports healthy plant growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Vinca is best planted in spring after the danger of frost has passed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Vinca blooms from late spring through fall, providing colorful flowers throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Vinca may enter a dormant phase in winter. Reduce watering and provide minimal care during this time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Vinca from severe cold and frost in winter. Consider bringing potted plants indoors or using frost protection measures.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Vinca prefers well-drained soil with a good amount of organic matter. A loamy soil enriched with compost works well.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> They grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing is recommended to maintain the right pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with organic matter before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure that containers have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Select healthy Vinca plants or cuttings from a trusted source. Look for robust foliage and well-developed roots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 12-18 inches apart to accommodate their growth. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or cutting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Proper planting depth is crucial for establishing a strong root system and encouraging healthy growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
