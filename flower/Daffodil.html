            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Daffodil</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Daffodils thrive in temperatures between 10째C to 18째C (50째F to 65째F). They are well-suited to temperate climates and require a cold period for optimal blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Daffodils require full sun to partial shade. They grow best with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity levels (40-60%) are ideal. Daffodils prefer well-drained soil and can tolerate dry conditions once established.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation to prevent bulb rot and fungal infections. Avoid overcrowded planting to allow for airflow.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Daffodils are typically planted in late fall, allowing them to establish before the spring blooming season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Daffodils usually bloom in early spring, providing a bright splash of color after winter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Daffodils go dormant in summer, with foliage dying back. During this period, they require minimal care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In regions with mild winters, a mulch layer can help protect the bulbs from fluctuating temperatures.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Daffodils prefer well-drained, sandy or loamy soil rich in organic matter. A mixture of garden soil and compost works well.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for Daffodils. Soil testing can help achieve the proper pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Loosen the soil before planting and mix in compost or other organic material to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> If planting in containers, ensure they have good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to bulb rot.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Planting and Care</h2>
            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bulb Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Daffodil bulbs from a reputable source. Look for firm bulbs without any soft spots or mold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space bulbs 4-6 inches apart to allow for their full growth. Plant bulbs at a depth of about 6 inches, with the pointed end facing up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure bulbs are set at the correct depth to promote strong root development and blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and help the bulbs establish.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil evenly moist after planting until the bulbs are established. Avoid overwatering, which can cause bulb rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Once established, water moderately during the growing season, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> During flowering, continue to water regularly, maintaining consistent soil moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during dormancy, allowing the soil to dry out slightly.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10. Apply in early spring as new growth appears.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil before planting and use it as a mulch to provide nutrients throughout the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed during the growing season to promote healthy growth and blooms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Bone meal is rich in phosphorus and supports healthy root development and flowering. Apply during planting and as a top dressing in early spring.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the base of the plant to prevent burn. Water the soil before and after fertilizing.</li>

            <article id="bulb-rot">
                <h3>7. Bulb Rot</h3>
                <p>Bulb rot is a common issue in Daffodils caused by fungal infections, often due to poor drainage or overly wet conditions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Soft, mushy bulbs with a foul odor, often accompanied by discolored or stunted growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Ensure good drainage in the planting area and avoid overwatering. Plant bulbs in well-drained soil and remove any infected bulbs promptly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Cure:</strong> Dust bulbs with sulfur before planting to reduce the risk of fungal infections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Cure:</strong> Apply a fungicide containing thiophanate-methyl to the planting area if bulb rot is a recurring issue. Follow label instructions for the correct application rate.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>8. Narcissus Fly</h3>
                <p>Narcissus flies are pests that can damage Daffodils by laying eggs near the bulbs, leading to larval infestations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Weak or stunted growth, distorted leaves, and the presence of larvae near the bulbs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Plant Daffodils deeply and cover with mulch to deter adult flies from laying eggs. Rotate planting areas to avoid infestations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Cure:</strong> Remove and destroy any infested bulbs. Encourage natural predators like birds to control the fly population.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Cure:</strong> Use an insecticide containing imidacloprid if infestations are severe. Follow label instructions for the correct application rate.</li>
