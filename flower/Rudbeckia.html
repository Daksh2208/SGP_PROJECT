            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Rudbeckia</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Rudbeckia thrive in a range of temperatures from 15°C to 28°C (59°F to 82°F). They are hardy plants but may need protection from extreme frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Rudbeckia prefer full sun but can tolerate partial shade. At least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily encourages abundant blooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Rudbeckia do well in moderate humidity. They can adapt to various humidity levels but may require additional moisture in very dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential for Rudbeckia to prevent fungal diseases and promote healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Rudbeckia are typically planted in spring or early summer when the risk of frost has passed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Rudbeckia bloom from mid-summer to fall, providing a burst of color throughout the season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Rudbeckia may enter a dormant phase in winter. During this time, reduce watering and provide minimal care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Rudbeckia from frost and cold winds in winter. In colder regions, consider mulching or covering the plants to protect them during the off-season.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Rudbeckia prefer well-drained soil with a good mix of organic matter. Loamy or sandy soil is ideal for their growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Rudbeckia grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Regular soil testing can help maintain the proper pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost or organic matter before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with excellent drainage. Ensure pots have drainage holes to avoid waterlogging.</li>

            <h2>Planting and Care</h2>
            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Rudbeckia plants or seeds from a reputable source. Look for plants with strong stems and vibrant leaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 18-24 inches apart to accommodate their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or as directed for seeds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and encourage vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering, as Rudbeckia are relatively drought-tolerant once established.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to keep the soil evenly moist, especially during dry spells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture during the flowering period to ensure vibrant blooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 20-20-20. Apply once in spring and again in mid-summer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil before planting and use it as mulch to provide ongoing nutrients throughout the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks to promote healthy growth and blooming.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Use seaweed extract as a foliar spray or soil drench to enhance plant health and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal during planting and mid-season to support root development and flowering.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the plant’s base to prevent burn. Water before and after applying fertilizer for best results.</li>
