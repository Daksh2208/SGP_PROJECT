            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Bougainvillea</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Bougainvillea thrives in temperatures between 20째C to 35째C (68째F to 95째F). It prefers warm climates and is sensitive to frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Bougainvillea requires full sun, with at least 5-6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate to high humidity levels (60-80%) are ideal. Bougainvillea prefers well-drained soil and can tolerate dry conditions once established.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal infections. Avoid overcrowded planting to allow for airflow.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Bougainvillea is best planted in the spring, after the last frost. This allows it to establish roots during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Bougainvillea typically blooms multiple times a year, with peak blooming in late spring and summer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Bougainvillea may enter a semi-dormant state during the cooler months, especially in temperate regions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Bougainvillea requires minimal care during the off-season. Prune lightly and reduce watering in winter.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Bougainvillea prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soil. A mixture of garden soil and sand works well.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 5.5 to 7.0 is ideal for Bougainvillea. Soil testing can help achieve the proper pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Loosen the soil before planting and mix in compost or other organic material to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> If planting in containers, ensure they have good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Bougainvillea plants from a reputable source. Ensure they are well-rooted and free of pests or diseases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting Method:</strong> Plant Bougainvillea at the same depth it was in the nursery pot, spacing plants about 3-5 feet apart. Water thoroughly after planting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Support Structure:</strong> If growing Bougainvillea as a vine, provide a sturdy support structure for it to climb.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and help the plant establish.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil evenly moist after planting until the plant is established. Avoid overwatering, which can cause rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Once established, water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> During flowering, water regularly but reduce frequency to encourage blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during dormancy, allowing the soil to dry out slightly.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 20-20-20. Apply every 4-6 weeks during active growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil before planting and use it as a mulch to provide nutrients throughout the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks to promote healthy growth and blooms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Seaweed extract can be used as a foliar spray or soil drench to improve plant health and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Bone meal is rich in phosphorus and supports healthy root development and flowering. Apply during planting and mid-season.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the base of the plant to prevent burn. Water the soil before and after fertilizing.</li>
