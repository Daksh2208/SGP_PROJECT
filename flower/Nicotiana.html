            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Nicotiana thrives in moderate temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). It can tolerate light frost but prefers a warm growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Nicotiana plants need full sun to partial shade. They perform best with at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Nicotiana enjoys moderate to high humidity. Ensure adequate moisture, particularly in drier climates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is crucial to prevent fungal diseases and promote healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Nicotiana is typically planted in spring after the last frost date. It establishes well when planted in early spring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Nicotiana generally blooms from summer to fall, offering fragrant flowers throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Nicotiana may die back in winter. Reduce watering and provide minimal care during this period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Nicotiana from severe frost and cold winds. In colder regions, consider bringing potted plants indoors or providing frost protection.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Nicotiana prefers well-drained soil rich in organic matter. A loamy soil with compost is ideal for healthy growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Nicotiana grows best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain the proper pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Amend the soil with organic matter before planting to enhance drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure pots have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Nicotiana plants or seeds from a reputable source. Look for vibrant foliage and strong stems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 12-18 inches apart to accommodate their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and promote vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
