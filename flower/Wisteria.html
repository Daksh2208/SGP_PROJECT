                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Wisteria thrives in temperatures ranging from 10째C to 30째C (50째F to 86째F). They are cold-hardy but should be protected from extreme frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Wisteria plants prefer full sun to light shade. They require at least 6 hours of sunlight per day to encourage abundant flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity is ideal for Wisteria. While they can tolerate dry conditions, adequate moisture will support healthy growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential to prevent fungal diseases and promote vigorous growth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Wisteria is best planted in late fall or early spring when the plant is dormant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Wisteria typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a spectacular display of flowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In colder regions, Wisteria may go dormant in winter. Reduce watering and cease fertilizing during this time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Provide winter protection in regions with severe frost. Mulching around the base of the plant can help insulate the roots.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Wisteria plants or grafted varieties from a reputable source. Ensure the plants are well-rooted and disease-free.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space Wisteria plants at least 10-15 feet apart to accommodate their vigorous growth. Plant them at the same depth as they were in the nursery container.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Proper planting depth is crucial to establish strong roots and support the plant's future growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help the roots establish in their new environment.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to promote root establishment. Avoid waterlogging to prevent root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season, especially during dry periods, to support healthy foliage and flower development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture during the flowering period to ensure a prolific bloom.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant phase, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
