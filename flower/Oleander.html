            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Oleander</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Oleander thrives in warm climates with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). It is not frost-tolerant and should be protected from cold temperatures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Oleander requires full sun to partial shade. It performs best with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day to promote healthy growth and flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Oleander can tolerate a range of humidity levels but prefers moderate to low humidity. It is drought-tolerant and can withstand dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is important to prevent fungal diseases and support overall plant health.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Oleander is best planted in spring or early summer when the risk of frost has passed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Oleander typically blooms from late spring to fall, providing vibrant and colorful flowers throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Oleander may enter a dormant phase during winter. During this time, reduce watering and provide minimal care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Oleander from frost and cold winds in winter. In colder regions, consider bringing potted plants indoors or providing frost protection.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Oleander prefers well-drained soil with a good balance of sand, silt, and clay. Sandy loam with added organic matter is ideal for optimal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Oleander grows best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain the appropriate pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Amend the soil with organic matter before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure pots have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

            <h2>Planting and Care</h2>
            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Oleander plants or seeds from a reputable source. Look for strong stems and vibrant foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 3-4 feet apart to accommodate their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and encourage vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to keep the soil evenly moist. Oleander plants are drought-tolerant but benefit from consistent moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture during the flowering period to ensure healthy blooms and foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 15-15-15. Apply every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil before planting and use it as mulch to provide ongoing nutrients throughout the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks to promote robust growth and flowering.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Use seaweed extract as a foliar spray or soil drench to enhance plant health and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal during planting and mid-season to support root development and flowering.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the plant’s base to prevent burn. Water before and after applying fertilizer for best results.</li>
