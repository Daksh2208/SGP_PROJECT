            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Jacaranda trees thrive in warm climates with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). They are sensitive to frost and require protection from extreme cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Jacarandas prefer full sun, needing at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to promote healthy growth and flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity is ideal. While Jacarandas can tolerate dry conditions, they benefit from additional moisture during prolonged dry spells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation around the Jacaranda is important to prevent fungal diseases and ensure robust growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Jacaranda trees are best planted in spring or early summer after the danger of frost has passed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> They typically bloom from late spring to summer, displaying their vibrant flowers during this period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Jacarandas may experience a dormant phase in winter. During this time, reduce watering and provide minimal care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Jacaranda trees from frost and harsh winds in winter. In colder regions, consider moving potted plants indoors or using frost protection.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Jacaranda trees prefer well-drained soil enriched with organic matter. A loamy soil mixed with compost is ideal for their growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> They grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing helps maintain the optimal pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Amend the soil with organic matter before planting to enhance drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure containers have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Jacaranda trees or seeds from a reputable source. Look for strong stems and well-developed foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space trees 15-25 feet apart to allow for their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and aid in the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering, which can cause root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to maintain evenly moist soil. Jacarandas need consistent moisture for optimal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture during the flowering period to ensure vibrant blooms and healthy foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
