            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Asters thrive in temperatures between 16째C to 24째C (60째F to 75째F). Cooler nights enhance their blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Asters prefer full sun but can tolerate partial shade. Ensure they receive at least 6 hours of sunlight daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity is ideal, around 40-60%. Asters are prone to powdery mildew in high humidity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is vital to prevent fungal diseases. Avoid overcrowding plants.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Asters are best planted in early spring or late summer. This timing ensures they establish well before blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Asters bloom from late summer to early fall, with flowers lasting until the first frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> After flowering, cut back the stems and allow the plant to rest during winter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Mulch the plants in winter to protect them from frost and provide nutrients for the next growing season.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Asters prefer well-drained, loamy soil. A mix of garden soil, sand, and organic compost is ideal.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A neutral to slightly alkaline soil with a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 is ideal for Asters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost or well-rotted manure before planting to enhance fertility and drainage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> If using containers, ensure they have good drainage. Aster roots are prone to rot in waterlogged conditions.</li>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seed or Seedling Selection:</strong> Choose healthy, disease-free seeds or seedlings. Heirloom varieties often provide the most vibrant flowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting Depth:</strong> Plant seeds or seedlings at a depth of 1/4 inch, ensuring they are spaced 12-18 inches apart to allow for growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water the seeds lightly after planting, keeping the soil moist but not waterlogged until germination.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings are established. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water Asters deeply once a week, allowing the soil to dry slightly between watering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain consistent moisture during flowering, but avoid wetting the foliage to reduce the risk of disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering after flowering and during dormancy to prevent the roots from sitting in soggy soil.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring and mid-summer. A 10-10-10 ratio works well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Use compost as a mulch or incorporate it into the soil to provide a steady supply of nutrients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion every 3-4 weeks during the growing season for a nutrient boost.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Use as a foliar spray to promote healthy growth and disease resistance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal during planting to support strong root development and flower production.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Water the soil before and after fertilizing to help distribute nutrients and prevent root burn.</li>
