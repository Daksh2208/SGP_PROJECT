            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Lilies</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Lilies prefer moderate temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They are hardy and can tolerate light frost but perform best in a temperate climate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Lilies require full sun to partial shade. They thrive with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to promote healthy growth and flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity is beneficial. While Lilies are not highly sensitive to humidity, they grow better in environments with consistent moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation to prevent diseases and encourage robust growth.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Lilies are typically planted in early spring or late summer, depending on the region and variety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Lilies generally bloom in mid to late summer, providing vibrant flowers throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Lilies may go dormant in winter. Reduce watering during this period and allow the soil to dry out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Lilies from extreme cold and harsh winter conditions. In colder areas, mulch around the base of the plants for insulation.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Lilies prefer well-drained soil rich in organic matter. A loamy soil with added compost is ideal for promoting healthy root development.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Lilies grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing helps maintain proper pH levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Amend the soil with organic matter before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure pots have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Lily bulbs from a reputable source. Look for firm, plump bulbs without signs of disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space bulbs 6-12 inches apart, depending on the variety. Plant bulbs at a depth of 2-3 times their height.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Proper planting depth supports healthy root development and encourages strong growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the bulb’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering to prevent bulb rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to maintain even moisture levels. Lilies need consistent moisture to thrive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Ensure the soil remains moist during the flowering period to support healthy blooms and foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 15-15-15. Apply every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>

                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal during planting and mid-season to support root development and flowering.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the plant’s base to prevent burn. Water before and after applying fertilizer for best results.</li>
