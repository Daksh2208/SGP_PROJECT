            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Balsam</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Balsam thrives in temperatures between 20째C to 30째C (68째F to 86째F). It prefers warm weather and may struggle in cold temperatures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Balsam requires partial to full shade, with 4-6 hours of indirect sunlight daily. Excessive direct sunlight can cause wilting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> High humidity levels (60-80%) are ideal. Balsam prefers moist conditions and may wilt in dry air.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal infections. Avoid overcrowded planting to allow for airflow.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Balsam is best planted in late spring or early summer after the last frost. Ensure the soil is warm enough for germination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Blooms typically appear 8-12 weeks after planting and can last through summer into early fall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Balsam does not have a true resting period but will naturally decline as temperatures drop in fall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In cooler climates, Balsam can be grown indoors or in greenhouses during the off-season.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Balsam prefers well-drained, rich soil with plenty of organic matter. A mixture of garden soil, peat moss, and compost works well.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for Balsam. Soil testing can help achieve the proper pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Loosen the soil before planting and mix in compost or other organic material to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> If planting in containers, ensure they have good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.</li>

            <h2>Planting and Care</h2>
            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seed Selection:</strong> Choose high-quality seeds from a reputable source. Balsam seeds are easy to germinate and can be sown directly in the garden.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seed Planting:</strong> Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep in the soil, spacing them about 6-8 inches apart. Lightly cover with soil and water gently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Sow seeds at a shallow depth and cover lightly with soil. This ensures good contact with the soil for germination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water gently after planting to settle the soil. Keep the soil consistently moist until germination occurs.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil evenly moist until seedlings emerge, which usually takes 7-14 days. Avoid overwatering, which can cause rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Once established, water regularly to maintain consistent soil moisture. Balsam does not tolerate dry soil.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> During flowering, continue to water regularly, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> As Balsam is an annual plant, it will naturally decline at the end of the season, and watering can be reduced.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10. Apply every 2-4 weeks during active growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil before planting and use it as a mulch to provide nutrients throughout the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 3-4 weeks to promote strong growth and vibrant blooms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Seaweed extract can be used as a foliar spray or soil drench to improve plant health and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Bone meal is rich in phosphorus and supports healthy root development and flowering. Apply during planting and mid-season.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the base of the plant to prevent burn. Water the soil before and after fertilizing.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="powdery-mildew">
                <h3>7. Powdery Mildew</h3>
                <p>Powdery mildew is a common fungal disease that affects Balsam, leading to white powdery spots on the leaves and stems.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> White powdery spots on the leaves, stems, and flowers. Infected leaves may curl and drop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Provide good air circulation and avoid overhead watering. Remove infected plant material promptly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Cure:</strong> Spray with a solution of water and baking soda (1 tablespoon per gallon of water) weekly until symptoms subside.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Cure:</strong> Apply a fungicide containing sulfur or neem oil. Follow label instructions for the correct application rate.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="root-rot">
                <h3>8. Root Rot</h3>
                <p>Root rot is caused by overwatering or poorly drained soil, leading to the decay of roots and eventual plant death.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Wilting leaves, stunted growth, and blackened or mushy roots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Ensure pots have adequate drainage, and avoid waterlogged soil. Water sparingly and allow the soil to dry between watering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Cure:</strong> Remove affected plants, trim away diseased roots, and replant in fresh, well-draining soil. Use a natural fungicide like cinnamon powder on the roots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Cure:</strong> Treat the soil with a fungicide drench at the first sign of disease. Follow up with regular fungicide applications during the growing season.</li>
