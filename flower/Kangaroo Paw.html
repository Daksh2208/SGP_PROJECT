                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Kangaroo Paw thrives in warm climates with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They are not frost-tolerant and need protection from extreme cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Kangaroo Paw plants prefer full sun to partial shade. At least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily will encourage the best flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Kangaroo Paw is adapted to dry conditions but will benefit from occasional watering during extended dry periods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is important to prevent fungal diseases and support healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Kangaroo Paw should be planted in spring or early summer after the last frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Kangaroo Paw typically blooms from late spring through summer, offering vibrant color during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Kangaroo Paw may enter a dormant phase in winter. Reduce watering and provide minimal care during this time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Kangaroo Paw from frost and cold winds. In colder regions, consider covering plants or bringing potted varieties indoors.</li>
