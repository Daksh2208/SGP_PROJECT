            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Eustomas thrive in temperatures between 18째C to 24째C (64째F to 75째F). They prefer mild climates and may struggle in extreme heat or cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Eustomas require full sun to partial shade. They grow best with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity levels (50-70%) are ideal. They prefer well-drained soil and may struggle in overly dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal infections. Avoid overcrowded planting to allow for airflow.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Eustomas are typically planted in spring or early summer to allow them to establish before the flowering season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Eustomas usually bloom in late summer to fall, providing a burst of color in the garden.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Eustomas may go dormant in winter, with foliage dying back. During this period, they require minimal care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In regions with harsh winters, mulch around the base to protect the plant from freezing temperatures.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Eustomas prefer well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter. A mixture of garden soil and compost works well.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for Eustomas. Soil testing can help achieve the proper pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Loosen the soil before planting and mix in compost or other organic material to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> If planting in containers, ensure they have good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.</li>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Eustoma plants or seeds from a reputable source. Look for vibrant foliage and strong stems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 6-12 inches apart to allow for their full growth. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure plants are set at the correct depth to promote strong root development and blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and help the plants establish.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil evenly moist after planting until the plants are established. Avoid overwatering, which can cause root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Once established, water regularly during the growing season, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> During flowering, continue to water regularly, maintaining consistent soil moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during dormancy, allowing the soil to dry out slightly.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10. Apply every 4-6 weeks during active growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil before planting and use it as a mulch to provide nutrients throughout the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks to promote healthy growth and blooms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Seaweed extract can be used as a foliar spray or soil drench to improve plant health and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Bone meal is rich in phosphorus and supports healthy root development and flowering. Apply during planting and mid-season.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the base of the plant to prevent burn. Water the soil before and after fertilizing.</li>
