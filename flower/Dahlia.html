            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Dahlia</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Dahlias thrive in temperatures between 15째C to 30째C (59째F to 86째F). They prefer warm climates and may struggle in frost or extreme cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Dahlias require full sun. They grow best with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity levels (50-70%) are ideal. Well-drained soil is essential to avoid rot in high humidity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal infections. Avoid overcrowded planting to allow for airflow.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Dahlias are typically planted in spring after the last frost. They require warm soil to establish and grow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Dahlias usually bloom from mid-summer to fall, providing continuous color in the garden.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Dahlias go dormant in winter. In colder climates, tubers should be dug up and stored indoors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In regions with frost, lift and store tubers in a cool, dry place over winter.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Dahlias prefer well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter. A mixture of garden soil and compost works well.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for Dahlias. Soil testing can help achieve the proper pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Loosen the soil before planting and mix in compost or other organic material to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> If planting in containers, ensure they have good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.</li>

                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 12-24 inches apart depending on the variety. Plant tubers 4-6 inches deep with the eye facing up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure tubers are set at the correct depth to promote strong root development and blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and help the plants establish.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil evenly moist after planting until the plants are established. Avoid overwatering, which can cause rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Once established, water regularly during the growing season, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> During flowering, continue to water regularly, maintaining consistent soil moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during dormancy, allowing the soil to dry out slightly.</li>
                </ul>

                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Seaweed extract can be used as a foliar spray or soil drench to improve plant health and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Bone meal is rich in phosphorus and supports healthy root development and flowering. Apply during planting and mid-season.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the base of the plant to prevent burn. Water the soil before and after fertilizing.</li>
