            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Jatropha</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Jatropha thrives in warm climates, ideally between 25°C to 35°C (77°F to 95°F). It is tolerant of drought but sensitive to frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Jatropha needs full sun exposure for at least 6 hours daily to ensure optimal growth and seed production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Jatropha is adapted to low humidity environments but can benefit from occasional watering during dry spells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential to prevent fungal diseases and promote healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Jatropha is best planted at the beginning of the rainy season or during spring in tropical regions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> The plant typically flowers from late summer to early fall, with the peak flowering period depending on the local climate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Jatropha may enter a semi-dormant phase in winter, requiring reduced care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Jatropha from frost and extreme cold. In non-tropical areas, consider providing frost protection or moving potted plants indoors.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Jatropha prefers well-drained soil with a high sand content. It can tolerate a range of soil types but thrives in sandy loam.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The plant grows best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Improve soil fertility and drainage by adding organic matter such as compost before planting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a well-draining potting mix and ensure containers have adequate drainage holes.</li>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Jatropha seedlings or seeds from a reputable supplier. Look for strong stems and vibrant leaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 3-5 feet apart to accommodate their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and avoid waterlogging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season, but allow the soil to dry out between waterings to avoid excess moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture during flowering to support healthy blooms and seed production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out more significantly between waterings.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 20-20-20. Apply every 6-8 weeks during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
