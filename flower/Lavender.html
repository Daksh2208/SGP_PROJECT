            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Lavender</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Lavender prefers warm, temperate climates with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). It can tolerate frost but thrives in milder winters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Lavender needs full sun to grow well. Aim for at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day to ensure strong growth and abundant flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Lavender prefers low to moderate humidity. It is well-suited to dry conditions and can struggle in overly humid environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential to prevent fungal diseases and promote healthy plant growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Plant Lavender in spring or early fall. Avoid planting in winter to prevent root rot from cold, wet conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Lavender typically blooms from late spring to summer, producing its signature purple flowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In colder climates, Lavender may enter a dormant phase in winter. During this time, reduce watering and avoid heavy pruning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Lavender from severe frost and wet conditions in winter. In colder areas, consider mulching or bringing potted plants indoors.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Lavender thrives in well-drained soil with good aeration. Sandy or loamy soil with added organic matter is ideal.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Lavender prefers slightly alkaline soil with a pH range of 6.5 to 8.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain the proper pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Improve soil drainage by incorporating sand or gravel. Avoid heavy, clayey soils that retain too much moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a well-draining potting mix and ensure containers have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Planting and Care</h2>
            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Lavender plants or seeds from a reputable source. Look for strong, well-developed roots and vibrant foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 24-36 inches apart to allow for their mature spread. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support robust root development and encourage strong growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment, but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season but allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Lavender is drought-tolerant once established.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain moderate soil moisture to support flowering, but avoid waterlogging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period and allow the soil to dry out significantly between waterings.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with a low nitrogen ratio, such as 5-10-10, applied sparingly during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>

                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal during planting to support root development.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Use fish emulsion as a supplement to boost plant growth if necessary.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the plant’s base. Water the plant before and after applying fertilizer for best results.</li>
