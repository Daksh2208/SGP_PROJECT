                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Kalanchoe thrive in warm temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They are sensitive to frost and should be protected from cold temperatures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Kalanchoe plants require bright, indirect light. They can tolerate some direct sunlight but should be protected from intense midday sun.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Kalanchoe prefer low to moderate humidity. Avoid high humidity levels, as this can promote fungal diseases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation around Kalanchoe to prevent mold and mildew and to encourage healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Kalanchoe can be planted year-round but are often started in spring or summer when conditions are favorable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Kalanchoe typically bloom in winter or early spring, offering bright, cheerful flowers during the colder months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> During the winter, Kalanchoe may enter a resting phase. Reduce watering and allow the soil to dry out between waterings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Kalanchoe from frost and cold drafts. Maintain indoor temperatures and avoid exposing the plant to extreme conditions.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Kalanchoe prefer well-drained soil with a sandy or gritty texture. A cactus or succulent mix is ideal.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Kalanchoe grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain proper pH levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Use a well-draining soil mix to prevent waterlogging and root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, ensure pots have drainage holes to avoid excess moisture accumulation.</li>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Kalanchoe plants or cuttings from a reputable source. Look for vibrant leaves and strong, well-formed stems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 6-12 inches apart to accommodate their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or cutting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and prevent rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil slightly moist after planting but avoid overwatering. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season, but let the soil dry out completely between waterings to prevent root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain moderate soil moisture during the flowering period to support blooms and foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out more between waterings.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 15-15-15. Apply every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>

                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Use seaweed extract as a foliar spray or soil drench to enhance plant health.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal during planting to support root development and flowering.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid over-fertilizing, which can lead to excessive leaf growth at the expense of blooms. Water before and after applying fertilizer for best results.</li>
