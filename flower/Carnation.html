                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Carnations thrive in temperatures between 15째C to 20째C (59째F to 68째F). They prefer moderate climates and may struggle in extreme heat or cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Carnations require full sun to partial shade, with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Carnations prefer low to moderate humidity. They should be grown in well-ventilated areas to prevent fungal diseases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential to prevent disease. Space plants adequately to allow for airflow.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Carnations are best planted in early spring or late fall. This allows them to establish roots before the main growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Carnations typically bloom from late spring to early fall, offering a long period of colorful flowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Carnations may enter a dormant period in the winter. During this time, reduce watering and avoid fertilizing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In colder climates, provide protection with mulch or cover to prevent frost damage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Carnations prefer well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter. A sandy loam with good drainage is ideal.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is best for Carnations. Soil testing can help achieve the proper pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Improve soil drainage and fertility by incorporating compost or well-rotted manure before planting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> When planting in containers, ensure they have drainage holes and use a well-draining potting mix.</li>
