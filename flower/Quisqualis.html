                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
