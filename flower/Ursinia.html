            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Ursinia</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Ursinia thrives in warm climates with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They are tolerant of light frost but prefer warmer conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Ursinia requires full sun to partial shade. They need at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight daily to produce vibrant blooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity is ideal. Ursinia is adaptable but benefits from additional moisture in very dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is important to prevent fungal diseases and ensure healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> The best time to plant Ursinia is in spring after the last frost has passed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Ursinia blooms from late spring to early fall, providing a burst of color throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Ursinia may experience a dormant phase in winter. Reduce watering and minimize care during this time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Ursinia from extreme cold and frost in winter. In colder regions, consider moving potted plants indoors or providing frost protection.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Ursinia prefers well-drained soil enriched with organic matter. A loamy soil with added compost is ideal for healthy growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Ursinia grows best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain optimal pH levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Prepare the soil by incorporating organic matter before planting to enhance drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure containers have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Select healthy Ursinia plants or seeds from a reputable source. Look for robust plants with strong stems and vibrant foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 12-18 inches apart to allow for their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure the planting depth supports healthy root development and encourages vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to maintain evenly moist soil. Ursinia needs consistent moisture to thrive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture during the flowering period to promote healthy blooms and foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 15-15-15. Apply every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil before planting and use it as mulch for ongoing nutrients throughout the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks to support robust growth and flowering.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Use seaweed extract as a foliar spray or soil drench to enhance plant health and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal during planting and mid-season to support root development and flowering.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the plant’s base to prevent burn. Water before and after applying fertilizer for best results.</li>
