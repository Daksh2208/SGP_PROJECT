                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Xanthoceras grows best in temperatures ranging from 10째C to 20째C (50째F to 68째F). It is sensitive to extreme heat and cold, requiring protection in harsh climates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Xanthoceras prefers full sun to light shade, needing at least 6 hours of sunlight daily to thrive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity levels are ideal, though the plant can adapt to drier conditions with proper care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation to reduce the risk of fungal infections and support healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Plant Xanthoceras in early spring when the soil begins to warm up, avoiding late frosts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Xanthoceras typically blooms in late spring to early summer, showcasing its stunning flowers during this period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> During the winter months, Xanthoceras may go dormant. Reduce watering and provide protection from freezing temperatures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In regions with harsh winters, consider mulching around the base of the plant or using frost blankets to protect it from extreme cold.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Planting and Care</h2>
            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Xanthoceras plants or seeds from reputable sources. Look for signs of strong growth and disease-free foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants about 15-20 inches apart to allow adequate room for growth. Plant at the same depth as the root ball or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Correct planting depth is essential for root development and plant stability. Ensure the root crown is at or just below the soil surface.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and initiate root establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil evenly moist during the initial growth phase, but avoid waterlogging which can lead to root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly, allowing the soil to dry slightly between watering to promote healthy root development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain consistent soil moisture during flowering to ensure vibrant blooms and prevent wilting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant winter period, allowing the soil to dry out more between waterings.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer (10-10-10) in early spring to support new growth. Repeat application every 6-8 weeks during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>

                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Use fish emulsion every 4-6 weeks to enhance growth and promote healthy foliage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Apply seaweed extract as a foliar spray to boost plant vitality and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Mix bone meal into the soil at planting and mid-season to encourage root and flower development.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid direct contact of fertilizers with the plant base. Water before and after fertilizing to help distribute nutrients and prevent root burn.</li>
