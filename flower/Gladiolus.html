            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Gladiolus</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Gladiolus thrive in temperatures between 18째C to 25째C (65째F to 77째F). They prefer moderate temperatures and are sensitive to frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Gladiolus require full sun for at least 6-8 hours a day. They need ample sunlight for robust growth and flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Gladiolus do well in average to moderate humidity levels. They are relatively tolerant of varying humidity conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation helps prevent diseases. Space plants adequately to ensure proper airflow around them.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Plant Gladiolus corms in spring after the last frost date. This allows the plants to establish before the heat of summer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Gladiolus typically bloom in mid to late summer, producing tall spikes of flowers that last several weeks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> After flowering, Gladiolus enter a dormant phase. Reduce watering and allow the foliage to die back naturally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In colder climates, lift corms after the first frost and store them in a cool, dry place until the next planting season.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Gladiolus prefer well-drained soil with good fertility. A loamy soil with added organic matter is ideal.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A neutral to slightly acidic soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 works best for Gladiolus. Test soil pH regularly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure into the soil to improve drainage and nutrient content before planting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container gardening, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure pots have adequate drainage holes.</li>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Corm Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Gladiolus corms from a reputable supplier. Look for firm, plump corms free from mold or damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space corms 6-8 inches apart and plant them 4-6 inches deep. Ensure the pointed end of the corm faces upward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Plant at the correct depth to support strong root growth and stability during flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and encourage root establishment.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to aid in corm development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season, especially during dry spells. Avoid waterlogging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Ensure consistent soil moisture during the flowering period to support healthy blooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering after flowering and allow the foliage to die back naturally before lifting corms for storage.</li>
