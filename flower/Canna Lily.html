            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Canna Lily</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Canna Lilies thrive in temperatures between 20째C to 30째C (68째F to 86째F). They prefer warm climates and can tolerate heat well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Canna Lilies require full sun to partial shade, flourishing in sunny spots with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> High humidity levels (60-80%) are ideal. Canna Lilies prefer moist, well-drained soil and may struggle in dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal infections. Avoid overcrowded planting to allow for airflow.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Canna Lilies are best planted in the spring, after the danger of frost has passed. They require warm soil to establish roots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Canna Lilies typically bloom from late summer to early fall, providing continuous color during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Canna Lilies enter dormancy in the winter in colder climates. In warmer regions, they may continue growing year-round.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In colder areas, dig up the rhizomes and store them in a cool, dry place for the winter. Replant in spring.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Canna Lilies prefer rich, well-drained soil with plenty of organic matter. A mixture of garden soil and compost works well.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for Canna Lilies. Soil testing can help achieve the proper pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Loosen the soil before planting and mix in compost or other organic material to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> If planting in containers, ensure they have good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rhizome Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Canna Lily rhizomes from a reputable source. They should be firm and free of mold or damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rhizome Planting:</strong> Plant Canna Lily rhizomes 4-6 inches deep in the soil, spacing them about 1-2 feet apart. Water thoroughly after planting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure rhizomes are planted at the correct depth to promote strong root development and flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and help the rhizomes establish.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil evenly moist after planting until the rhizomes are established. Avoid overwatering, which can cause rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Once established, water regularly during the growing season, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> During flowering, continue to water regularly, maintaining consistent soil moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during dormancy, allowing the soil to dry out slightly.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10. Apply every 4-6 weeks during active growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil before planting and use it as a mulch to provide nutrients throughout the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks to promote healthy growth and blooms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Seaweed extract can be used as a foliar spray or soil drench to improve plant health and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Bone meal is rich in phosphorus and supports healthy root development and flowering. Apply during planting and mid-season.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the base of the plant to prevent burn. Water the soil before and after fertilizing.</li>
