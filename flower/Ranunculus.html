                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Ranunculus thrive in cool temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C (50°F to 68°F). They prefer mild climates and can be sensitive to extreme heat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Ranunculus plants need full sun to partial shade. They require at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to encourage robust blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity is ideal for Ranunculus. They do well in environments with consistent moisture levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation around Ranunculus to prevent fungal diseases and promote healthy growth.</li>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Ranunculus corms or plants from a reputable source. Look for firm corms with no signs of rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space corms 6-8 inches apart to accommodate their mature size. Plant corms with the pointed end down, about 2 inches deep.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and encourage vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to keep the soil evenly moist. Ranunculus plants need consistent moisture to thrive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture during the flowering period to ensure healthy blooms and foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
