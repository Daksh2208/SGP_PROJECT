                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Roses thrive in moderate climates, with ideal temperatures between 15째C and 25째C (59째F to 77째F). While they can tolerate warmer conditions, cooler evenings promote better blooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Roses require full sun for at least 6 hours daily to ensure vibrant flowering and healthy growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Roses prefer moderate humidity but can adapt to various humidity levels with proper care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential to prevent fungal diseases, especially in humid climates.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Roses are best planted in early spring or late fall. These seasons offer optimal conditions for root establishment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Roses typically bloom from spring through fall, with peak blooming in late spring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Roses benefit from a dormancy period in colder seasons, which encourages vigorous growth and flowering in spring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Prune roses in late winter to shape the plant and remove old blooms. Mulch around the base to protect roots during winter.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Roses grow best in well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Roses prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Amend soil with compost or manure before planting to boost fertility.</li>
