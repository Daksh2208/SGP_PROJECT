                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Gerberas thrive in temperatures between 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They prefer mild climates and can struggle with extreme heat or cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Gerberas require full sun to partial shade. Ideally, they should receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity levels are best for Gerberas. They can tolerate average humidity but may struggle in overly dry or extremely humid conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation helps prevent fungal diseases. Space plants adequately to ensure airflow around them.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Gerberas are usually planted in spring after the last frost. They can also be started indoors before the outdoor planting season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Gerberas typically bloom from late spring through summer, offering a colorful display for several months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Gerberas may enter a dormancy period in winter. During this time, reduce watering and avoid fertilizing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In colder climates, protect Gerberas from frost by covering them or bringing potted plants indoors during winter.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Gerberas prefer well-drained soil rich in organic matter. A mix of garden soil with compost or peat moss works well.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 6.8 is ideal for Gerberas. Regular soil testing can help maintain the proper pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Enhance soil drainage and fertility by incorporating compost before planting. Ensure good drainage to avoid waterlogging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with excellent drainage. Ensure pots have drainage holes to prevent water accumulation.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Gerbera plants or seeds from a reputable source. Look for vibrant foliage and strong stems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 12-18 inches apart to allow for their full spread. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season, ensuring the soil remains moist but not soggy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain consistent soil moisture during blooming to support vibrant flowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly.</li>
