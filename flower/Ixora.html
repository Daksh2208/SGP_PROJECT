                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Ixora thrives in warm climates with temperatures ranging from 18°C to 32°C (64°F to 90°F). It is sensitive to cold and frost and should be kept in a warm environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Ixora prefers full sun to partial shade, with at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight daily to encourage optimal flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> High humidity is ideal for Ixora, which thrives in moist, tropical conditions. Supplemental humidity may be needed in drier climates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is important for Ixora to prevent fungal diseases and promote healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Ixora is best planted in spring or early summer when temperatures are consistently warm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Ixora typically blooms from late spring through early fall, producing vibrant flower clusters during this time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Ixora may enter a resting period in winter. Reduce watering and provide minimal care during this time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Ixora from frost and cold winds in winter. In colder regions, consider growing Ixora in containers that can be brought indoors.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Ixora prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil rich in organic matter. A mix of loamy soil with added compost is ideal.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Ixora grows best in soil with a pH range of 5.5 to 6.5. Regular soil testing can help maintain the appropriate pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Before planting, amend the soil with organic matter to improve its drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a well-draining potting mix. Ensure containers have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Ixora plants or seeds from a reputable nursery. Look for vibrant leaves and strong, healthy roots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space Ixora plants 12-18 inches apart to accommodate their growth. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to encourage healthy root development and vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and establish the plant.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering, which can cause root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to keep the soil evenly moist. Ixora needs consistent moisture to thrive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture during the flowering period to ensure healthy blooms and foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
                </ul>
