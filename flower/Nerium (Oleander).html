            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Nerium (Oleander)</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Oleander thrives in warm climates with temperatures ranging from 15째C to 30째C (59째F to 86째F). It is tolerant of heat but can be sensitive to frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Oleander requires full sun for optimal growth and flowering. It performs best with at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Oleander is quite drought-tolerant and prefers dry to moderately humid conditions. It is not particularly sensitive to humidity changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is important to prevent fungal diseases and ensure healthy growth. Space plants adequately to allow for proper air flow.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Oleander is best planted in spring or early summer, after the last frost date, to allow for a full growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Oleander generally blooms from late spring through summer, providing a long period of vibrant flowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In colder climates, Oleander may experience a dormant period in winter. During this time, reduce watering and protect from frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In areas with frost, provide protection such as mulch or cover plants to shield them from cold temperatures.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
            <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Oleander prefers well-drained soil with good drainage. Sandy or loamy soil is ideal, and the addition of compost can enhance soil fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Oleander grows well in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain the proper pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Prepare the soil by mixing in organic matter before planting to improve its structure and nutrient content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage and ensure pots have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Oleander plants or cuttings from a reliable source. Look for strong stems and vibrant leaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 3-5 feet apart to accommodate their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or cutting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and establish a stable plant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant's establishment.</li>
                </ul>
