            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Hollyhock</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Hollyhocks prefer mild to warm temperatures, typically ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They can tolerate cooler climates but may need protection from frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Hollyhocks thrive in full sun. They require at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to promote vigorous growth and flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity is ideal for Hollyhocks. They do well in temperate climates and may need additional moisture in arid conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is important to prevent fungal diseases such as rust, which can affect Hollyhocks.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Hollyhocks are typically planted in late spring or early summer when the soil has warmed up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Hollyhocks bloom from midsummer to early fall, showcasing tall spikes of flowers in various colors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Hollyhocks may go dormant in winter, especially in colder climates. During this time, reduce watering and allow the plants to rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In colder regions, protect Hollyhocks from frost by mulching or covering with frost cloth. In mild climates, they may remain semi-evergreen.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Hollyhocks prefer well-drained, fertile soil. A loamy or sandy soil enriched with organic matter is ideal for healthy growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Hollyhocks grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Regular soil testing can help maintain the appropriate pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Work compost or well-rotted manure into the soil before planting to improve fertility and drainage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> Hollyhocks can be grown in large containers with well-draining soil. Ensure containers have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Hollyhock plants or seeds from a reputable source. Look for strong stems and disease-free foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 18-24 inches apart to allow for their tall growth and prevent overcrowding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Plant Hollyhocks at the same depth as their nursery containers or seedlings to encourage strong root development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help establish the plants and encourage deep rooting.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support early growth. Avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season, especially in dry periods, to keep the soil evenly moist.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain consistent watering during flowering to ensure healthy blooms and prevent wilting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during dormancy, allowing the soil to dry slightly between waterings.</li>
                </ul>
