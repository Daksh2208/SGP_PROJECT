            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Water Lily</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Water Lilies thrive in temperatures between 21째C to 30째C (70째F to 86째F). They require warm conditions to bloom effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Water Lilies need full sun, at least 6-8 hours of sunlight per day, to promote healthy flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> High humidity is beneficial for Water Lilies, but they can adapt to varying humidity levels as long as their roots remain submerged in water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation helps prevent fungal diseases, but ensure the water surface remains undisturbed.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Water Lilies are best planted in late spring to early summer when water temperatures are consistently warm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Water Lilies bloom from late spring through summer, providing stunning flowers throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Water Lilies enter a dormant phase in winter. Reduce care during this time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In cold regions, move Water Lilies indoors or to a frost-free environment to protect them from freezing temperatures.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Water Lilies prefer heavy clay soil that can anchor their roots underwater. A soil mix designed for aquatic plants is ideal.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> They grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Regular soil testing is recommended to maintain the right pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with aquatic plant fertilizer before planting to provide essential nutrients.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use wide, shallow pots with no drainage holes to keep the soil submerged. Cover the soil surface with gravel to prevent erosion.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Select healthy Water Lily tubers or plants from a trusted source. Look for firm tubers and healthy roots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Plant the tubers in containers or directly in the pond soil, ensuring the growing tips are just above the soil surface.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Place containers or plant directly in water 12-18 inches deep, depending on the variety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Submerge the container or plant in water slowly to prevent disturbing the soil. Ensure the water level remains consistent.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the water level consistent to support root establishment and prevent the soil from drying out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water Lilies require consistent water levels. Top up the pond or container as needed to maintain the correct depth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain water quality and depth during the flowering period to support abundant blooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering in winter, especially in colder climates, to mimic natural conditions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use slow-release fertilizer tablets formulated for aquatic plants. Apply every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>

                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion sparingly to avoid contaminating the water, but it can promote healthy growth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Use seaweed extract as a foliar spray or soil drench to boost plant health.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal during planting to support root development and flowering.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid over-fertilizing, as it can lead to algae growth. Always follow the recommended dosage and application frequency.</li>
