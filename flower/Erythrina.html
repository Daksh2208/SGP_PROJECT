            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Erythrina</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Erythrinas prefer warm climates, thriving in temperatures between 20째C to 30째C (68째F to 86째F). They can tolerate mild frost but may struggle in prolonged cold conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Full sun exposure is ideal for Erythrinas. They require at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily to promote healthy growth and flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Erythrinas are adaptable to different humidity levels but prefer moderate to high humidity. They can tolerate drought conditions once established.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is crucial to prevent fungal diseases. Plant Erythrinas with adequate spacing to ensure proper airflow around the plants.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> The best time to plant Erythrina is in the spring or early summer, giving them time to establish before the flowering season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Erythrinas typically bloom from late spring to early summer, offering vibrant red blossoms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In colder climates, Erythrinas may go dormant during winter, requiring minimal care during this time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In regions with harsh winters, protect the base of the plant with mulch to insulate the roots from freezing temperatures.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Erythrinas prefer well-drained, sandy or loamy soil. They can tolerate poor soil but thrive in nutrient-rich environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A neutral to slightly acidic soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 is ideal for Erythrinas. Soil testing is recommended to achieve the optimal pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Before planting, loosen the soil and mix in organic compost to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> If planting in containers, ensure they are large enough to accommodate the roots and have good drainage to prevent waterlogging.</li>

            <h2>Planting and Care</h2>
            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Select healthy Erythrina saplings or seeds from a reputable nursery. Look for plants with sturdy stems and vibrant leaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space Erythrina plants 3-4 feet apart to accommodate their growth. Plant them at the same depth as they were in their nursery containers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure the plant is set at the correct depth, with the base of the stem level with the soil surface.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and support root establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged during the initial stages after planting. Avoid overwatering, which can cause root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Once established, Erythrinas are drought-tolerant but benefit from regular watering during prolonged dry periods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Continue to water consistently during the flowering season to support bloom production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the winter dormancy period, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 in early spring to encourage healthy growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil at planting and as a top dressing throughout the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion monthly during the growing season to boost nutrient levels.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Use seaweed extract as a foliar spray or soil drench to enhance plant vitality.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Bone meal, rich in phosphorus, can be applied at planting to support root development and flowering.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid fertilizing directly at the base of the plant to prevent root burn. Always water before and after applying fertilizers.</li>
