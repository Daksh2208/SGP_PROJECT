            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Jasmine thrives in warm climates with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). They are sensitive to frost and should be protected from extreme cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Jasmine plants need full sun to partial shade. They prefer at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight daily to promote healthy growth and flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> High humidity benefits Jasmine. They grow well in humid environments and may need extra moisture in dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential to prevent fungal diseases and promote robust growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Jasmine is best planted in spring or early summer when the risk of frost is minimal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Jasmine generally blooms from late summer to fall, offering beautiful, fragrant flowers throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Jasmine may enter a dormant phase in winter. Reduce watering and provide minimal care during this period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Jasmine from frost and cold winds in winter. In colder regions, consider moving potted plants indoors or providing frost protection.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Jasmine prefers well-drained soil rich in organic matter. A loamy soil with added compost is ideal for optimal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Jasmine grows best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing helps maintain the proper pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Amend the soil with organic matter before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure pots have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 18-24 inches apart to allow for their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and encourage vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
