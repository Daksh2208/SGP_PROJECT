                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Morning Glories thrive in warm climates with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They are sensitive to frost and should be protected from cold weather.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> These plants prefer full sun and need at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to flower abundantly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Morning Glories adapt well to average humidity levels but may benefit from extra moisture in very dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is important to prevent diseases and ensure healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Morning Glories are typically planted in spring after the last frost. They grow best in warm weather.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Morning Glories usually bloom from summer to fall, providing colorful flowers throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In colder climates, Morning Glories may die back in winter. Reduce watering and provide minimal care during this period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect plants from frost and extreme cold. In colder regions, consider bringing potted plants indoors or providing protection.</li>

                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Morning Glories prefer well-drained soil with plenty of organic matter. A loamy soil with added compost is ideal for optimal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> These plants grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain the proper pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Amend the soil with organic matter before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure pots have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>
