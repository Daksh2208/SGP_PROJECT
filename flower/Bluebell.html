            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Bluebell</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Bluebells thrive in temperatures between 15째C to 25째C (59째F to 77째F). They prefer cooler climates and may struggle in extreme heat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Bluebells require partial to full shade, flourishing under the canopy of trees or in shaded garden areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity levels (50-70%) are ideal. Bluebells prefer moist, well-drained soil and may struggle in overly dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal infections. Avoid overcrowded planting to allow for airflow.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Bluebells are best planted in the fall, allowing them to establish roots before the winter. Planting in spring is also possible in cooler climates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Bluebells typically bloom in late spring, creating a stunning display of blue flowers that last for several weeks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Bluebells enter dormancy in the summer after flowering. During this period, the foliage will die back, and the plant will rest until the next growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Bluebells require little care during the off-season. In areas with harsh winters, a layer of mulch can help protect the bulbs.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Bluebells prefer well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter. A mixture of garden soil and leaf mold works well.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for Bluebells. Soil testing can help achieve the proper pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Loosen the soil before planting and mix in compost or other organic material to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> If planting in containers, ensure they have good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bulb Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Bluebell bulbs from a reputable source. They should be firm and free of mold or damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bulb Planting:</strong> Plant Bluebell bulbs 4-6 inches deep in the soil, spacing them about 4-6 inches apart. Water thoroughly after planting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure bulbs are planted at the correct depth to promote strong root development and flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and help the bulbs establish.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil evenly moist after planting until the bulbs are established. Avoid overwatering, which can cause rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Once established, water regularly during the growing season, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> During flowering, continue to water regularly, maintaining consistent soil moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during dormancy, allowing the soil to dry out slightly.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10. Apply every 4-6 weeks during active growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil before planting and use it as a mulch to provide nutrients throughout the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks to promote healthy growth and blooms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Seaweed extract can be used as a foliar spray or soil drench to improve plant health and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Bone meal is rich in phosphorus and supports healthy root development and flowering. Apply during planting and mid-season.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the base of the plant to prevent burn. Water the soil before and after fertilizing.</li>
