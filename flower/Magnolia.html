            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Magnolias thrive in temperate climates with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They are generally hardy but can be sensitive to extreme cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Magnolias prefer full sun to partial shade. They require at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Average humidity levels are suitable for Magnolias. They can tolerate drier conditions but benefit from regular moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is important to prevent fungal diseases and support healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Magnolias are best planted in early spring or fall when the weather is mild and the risk of frost is minimal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Magnolias typically bloom in spring, offering beautiful flowers that last for several weeks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In colder climates, Magnolias may enter a dormant phase in winter. Reduce watering and avoid fertilizing during this period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Magnolias from frost and severe cold in winter. Use mulch to insulate the root zone if needed.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Magnolias prefer well-drained, slightly acidic soil. A mix of loamy soil with organic matter is ideal.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The best pH range for Magnolias is 5.5 to 6.5. Regular soil testing can help maintain the proper pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Amend the soil with compost or peat moss to improve drainage and fertility before planting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure pots have adequate drainage holes.</li>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Magnolia plants or seeds from a reputable nursery. Look for strong, disease-free plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 6-10 feet apart to accommodate their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and avoid burying the trunk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
