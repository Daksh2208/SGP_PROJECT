                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Frangipanis thrive in warm temperatures between 20째C to 30째C (68째F to 86째F). They are not frost-tolerant and should be protected from cold weather.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Frangipanis require full sun to partial shade. They need at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day to flourish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> They prefer moderate to high humidity but are relatively adaptable. Regular watering can help maintain moisture levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation around the plant to prevent fungal infections and promote healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Frangipanis are best planted in spring or early summer, giving them time to establish before the hotter months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> They typically bloom from late spring to fall, with some varieties flowering year-round in ideal conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler months, Frangipanis may go dormant. During this period, reduce watering and care needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In colder climates, protect plants with mulch or bring container-grown plants indoors during winter.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Frangipanis prefer well-drained, sandy to loamy soil. Ensure the soil is not too heavy or prone to waterlogging.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for Frangipanis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Improve soil drainage by mixing in sand or perlite. Avoid planting in poorly draining areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container gardening, use a cactus or succulent mix to ensure good drainage and prevent root rot.</li>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Frangipani plants or cuttings from a reputable source. Look for strong, healthy growth and vibrant leaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 3-5 feet apart to allow for their full spread. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or cutting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure plants are set at the proper depth to promote strong root development and support healthy growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help the plant establish and settle the soil.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil evenly moist after planting until the plant is established. Avoid overwatering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain consistent soil moisture during the flowering period to support blooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly.</li>
