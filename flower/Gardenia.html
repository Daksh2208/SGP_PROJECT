            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Gardenia</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Gardenias flourish in temperatures between 18°C to 24°C (65°F to 75°F). They are sensitive to frost and extreme temperatures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Gardenias need bright, indirect light. They can tolerate some direct sunlight but prefer filtered light to avoid leaf burn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> High humidity levels (60-70%) are ideal. Gardenias thrive in humid environments and may struggle in dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential to prevent fungal diseases. Ensure adequate space between plants for airflow.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Gardenias are typically planted in spring or early summer, allowing them to establish before the cooler months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Gardenias generally bloom in late spring to summer, providing aromatic flowers throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Gardenias may enter a dormant phase in winter. During this time, they require less water and minimal care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Gardenias from frost and cold winds in winter. Use mulch to insulate the roots in colder regions.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Gardenias prefer well-drained, acidic soil rich in organic matter. A blend of peat moss and garden soil is ideal.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Acidic soil with a pH range of 5.0 to 6.0 is best for Gardenias. Regular soil testing can help maintain the proper pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Amend the soil with organic matter before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, ensure pots have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.</li>
