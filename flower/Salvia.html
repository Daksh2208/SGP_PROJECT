            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Salvia</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Salvia thrives in warm temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They are generally tolerant of heat but should be protected from frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Salvia plants prefer full sun to partial shade. They need at least 6 hours of sunlight daily to bloom profusely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity is suitable for Salvia, although they can adapt to drier conditions if needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential to prevent fungal diseases and promote healthy growth in Salvia plants.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Salvia is best planted in spring or early summer when the danger of frost has passed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Salvia typically blooms from late spring to early fall, with some varieties flowering into late autumn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Salvia may go dormant in winter. Reduce watering and care during this period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Salvia from frost and cold winds in winter. In colder regions, mulching around the base can help insulate the roots.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Salvia prefers well-drained soil with a good mix of sand and organic matter. A sandy loam is ideal for promoting healthy growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Salvia grows well in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Regular soil testing is recommended to maintain the correct pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost or well-rotted manure before planting to improve fertility and drainage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with excellent drainage. Ensure pots have sufficient drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Salvia plants or cuttings from a reliable source. Look for plants with strong, upright stems and healthy foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 12-18 inches apart to allow for mature growth. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or cutting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support root development and encourage vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to keep the soil evenly moist, but allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture during the flowering period to ensure healthy blooms and foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 20-20-20. Apply every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>

                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks to promote robust growth and flowering.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Use seaweed extract as a foliar spray or soil drench to enhance plant health and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal during planting and mid-season to support root development and flowering.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the plant’s base to prevent burn. Water before and after applying fertilizer for best results.</li>
