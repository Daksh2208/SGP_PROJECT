            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Hydrangeas thrive in cool to mild temperatures, typically between 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They are sensitive to extreme heat and cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Hydrangeas prefer partial shade to full sun. In hotter climates, they benefit from afternoon shade to prevent wilting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate to high humidity levels are ideal for Hydrangeas. They do well in moist environments and may require additional watering in dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure adequate air circulation around Hydrangeas to reduce the risk of fungal diseases and promote healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Hydrangeas are typically planted in spring or fall, when temperatures are mild and favorable for root establishment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Hydrangeas bloom from late spring to early autumn, showcasing their vibrant flower clusters throughout the season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Hydrangeas may enter a dormant phase in winter. During this time, reduce watering and protect from frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Provide frost protection and avoid excessive pruning in winter to ensure healthy regrowth in the next season.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Hydrangeas prefer well-drained, fertile soil enriched with organic matter. A mix of loam, compost, and peat moss is ideal for optimal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The pH of the soil can affect the color of Hydrangea flowers. Acidic soil (pH 5.0-5.5) typically results in blue flowers, while alkaline soil (pH 6.0-6.5) leads to pink flowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter into the soil before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure pots have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Hydrangea plants or cuttings from a reputable source. Look for strong stems and vibrant foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 3-5 feet apart to allow for mature growth. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or cutting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to maintain even soil moisture. Hydrangeas require consistent watering to thrive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Ensure adequate soil moisture during the flowering period to promote healthy blooms and foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10. Apply in early spring and mid-summer for best results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil before planting and use it as mulch to provide ongoing nutrients throughout the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks to promote robust growth and flowering.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Use seaweed extract as a foliar spray or soil drench to enhance plant health and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal during planting and mid-season to support root development and flowering.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the plant’s base to prevent burn. Water before and after applying fertilizer for best results.</li>
