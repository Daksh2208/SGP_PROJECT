            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Flax Flower</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Flax flowers thrive in temperatures between 15째C to 20째C (59째F to 68째F). They prefer cool to moderate climates and may not tolerate extreme heat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Flax flowers require full sun to partial shade. They grow best with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity levels (40-60%) are ideal. They prefer well-drained soil and may struggle in overly wet conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal diseases. Avoid overcrowding to allow for adequate airflow.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Flax flowers are typically planted in early spring, as they need a cool growing period to establish well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Flax flowers usually bloom in late spring to early summer, offering a burst of color to the garden.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Flax flowers may go dormant in late summer or fall, with foliage dying back. Minimal care is required during this period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In regions with harsh winters, protect the plants with mulch or cover crops to shield them from freezing temperatures.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Flax flowers prefer well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter. A mix of garden soil and compost is ideal.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is best for Flax flowers. Soil testing can help ensure the proper pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Loosen the soil before planting and incorporate compost or other organic material to enhance drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> If growing in containers, ensure they have adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.</li>

                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 6-12 inches apart to allow for their full growth. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure plants are set at the correct depth to promote strong root development and blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and help the plants establish.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil evenly moist after planting until the plants are established. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Once established, water regularly during the growing season, ensuring the soil remains moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> During flowering, continue to water regularly to maintain consistent soil moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during dormancy, allowing the soil to dry out slightly.</li>
