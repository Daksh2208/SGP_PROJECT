            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Azaleas</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Azaleas prefer temperatures between 15째C to 20째C (59째F to 68째F). They can tolerate cooler temperatures but may struggle in extreme heat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Azaleas thrive in partial shade to full sun. They should receive filtered light or morning sun with afternoon shade to prevent leaf burn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Azaleas prefer moderate to high humidity levels. Dry conditions can lead to leaf drop and poor flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation around Azaleas to prevent fungal diseases. Avoid planting in overly crowded areas.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Azaleas are best planted in the fall or early spring. This allows the roots to establish before the hot summer or cold winter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Azaleas typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowering period can vary depending on the variety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> After blooming, Azaleas enter a dormant phase. Reduce watering and avoid fertilizing during this period.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Azaleas prefer acidic, well-drained soil. A mix of peat moss, pine bark, and sand provides good drainage and acidity.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic soil with a pH range of 4.5 to 6.0 is ideal for Azaleas. Soil testing kits can help maintain the correct pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Before planting, amend the soil with organic matter like peat moss or pine needles to improve acidity and drainage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> When planting in containers, use an acid-loving plant mix and ensure the container has drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

            <h2>Planting and Care</h2>
            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Azalea plants with well-developed root systems. Avoid plants with yellowing leaves or signs of disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting Depth:</strong> Plant Azaleas at the same depth they were growing in their nursery pots. Ensure the top of the root ball is level with the soil surface.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil around the roots. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Water Azaleas regularly to keep the soil consistently moist, especially during the establishment phase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> During the growing season, maintain consistent moisture. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry, but avoid overwatering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Keep soil evenly moist during flowering to support blooming. Water at the base of the plant to avoid wetting the foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period. Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer formulated for acid-loving plants. Apply according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually in early spring and late summer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Add compost or well-rotted manure to the soil to improve fertility and moisture retention.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Bone meal provides phosphorus to support root development and flowering. Apply during planting and as needed during the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks to provide essential nutrients and promote healthy growth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pine Needle Mulch:</strong> Use pine needle mulch around Azaleas to maintain soil acidity and retain moisture.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Follow the recommended application rates and avoid over-fertilizing, which can harm the plant. Water thoroughly after applying fertilizers.</li>

                <h3>7. Leaf Spot (Cercospora spp.)</h3>
                <p>Leaf spot is a fungal disease that causes dark spots with yellow halos on Azalea leaves, leading to premature leaf drop.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Dark, circular spots with yellow margins on leaves. Severe infections can cause extensive leaf loss.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Avoid overhead watering and ensure good air circulation. Remove and dispose of infected leaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Cure:</strong> Remove affected foliage and spray with a solution of neem oil or diluted vinegar to inhibit fungal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Cure:</strong> Apply a fungicide specifically labeled for leaf spot diseases, following the manufacturer's instructions.</li>

                <h3>8. Root Rot (Phytophthora spp.)</h3>
                <p>Root rot is caused by waterlogged soil and affects the roots, leading to poor growth and potential plant death.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Wilting, yellowing leaves, and blackened, mushy roots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid overwatering. Use well-drained soil and containers with drainage holes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Cure:</strong> Remove affected plants and replant in fresh, well-draining soil. Use a natural fungicide like cinnamon powder to treat the soil.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Cure:</strong> Apply a fungicide drench to the soil at the first sign of root rot. Follow up with regular applications as needed.</li>
