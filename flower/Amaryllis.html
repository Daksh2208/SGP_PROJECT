            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Amaryllis</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Amaryllis thrives in temperatures between 18째C to 24째C (65째F to 75째F). Excessively hot or cold temperatures can hinder growth and flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Amaryllis requires bright, indirect sunlight for 6-8 hours daily. Insufficient light can result in weak stems and fewer blooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity levels (40-60%) are ideal. High humidity can promote fungal diseases, while low humidity can dry out the plant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is necessary to prevent fungal infections. Avoid overcrowded planting areas.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Amaryllis is best planted in late fall for winter blooms or late winter for spring blooms. Ensure the bulbs are planted 6-10 weeks before the desired flowering period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Blooms typically appear 6-10 weeks after planting, depending on the bulb size, temperature, and care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> After flowering, allow the bulb to rest for at least 8 weeks before replanting or inducing another blooming cycle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> During the off-season, reduce watering and allow the leaves to die back naturally. Store the bulb in a cool, dry place.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> A well-drained potting mix is essential. A mixture of garden soil, sand, and organic compost in equal parts provides optimal aeration and nutrient retention.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for Amaryllis. Soil testing kits can help maintain the correct pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Before planting, loosen the soil and incorporate organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility and drainage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> If planting in containers, ensure they have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.</li>

            <h2>Planting and Care</h2>
            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bulb Selection:</strong> Choose firm, healthy bulbs without blemishes. Larger bulbs typically produce more flowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bulb Planting:</strong> Plant the bulb with its pointed end facing up, leaving about one-third of the bulb above the soil level. Spacing between bulbs should be about 6 inches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Plant bulbs at a depth where the top one-third remains above the soil surface. This prevents rot and encourages healthy growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water the bulb lightly after planting to settle the soil, but avoid overwatering until growth appears.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Water sparingly until new growth appears, usually after 2-3 weeks. Overwatering at this stage can cause bulb rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Once growth is visible, increase watering frequency, keeping the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> During flowering, maintain consistent moisture. Avoid getting water on the flowers to prevent spotting and decay.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> After flowering, gradually reduce watering as the leaves yellow and die back. Allow the bulb to dry out during dormancy.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 20-20-20. Apply every 2-4 weeks during active growth, reducing feeding as flowering approaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate well-rotted compost into the soil before planting. Top-dress with compost during the growing season to provide a slow-release source of nutrients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 3-4 weeks. It provides essential nutrients and promotes healthy foliage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Seaweed extract can be used as a foliar spray or soil drench to enhance plant vitality and improve resistance to pests and diseases.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Bone meal is rich in phosphorus, essential for strong root development and flower production. Apply during planting and as a top-dressing during the growing season.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> When using fertilizers, avoid direct contact with the bulb to prevent burn. Water the soil before and after applying to distribute nutrients evenly.</li>

                <h3>7. Red Blotch (Stagonospora curtisii)</h3>
                <p>This fungal disease causes red spots on leaves and flowers, leading to premature leaf drop and poor flower quality.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Reddish-brown spots on leaves, stems, and flowers. In severe cases, the bulb may also be affected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Use disease-free bulbs and ensure good air circulation around the plants. Avoid overhead watering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Cure:</strong> Remove and destroy affected plant parts. Spray with a neem oil solution weekly until symptoms subside.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Cure:</strong> Apply a fungicide containing copper or sulfur. Follow label instructions for the correct application rate.</li>

                <h3>8. Root Rot (Pythium spp., Rhizoctonia spp.)</h3>
                <p>Root rot is caused by overwatering or poorly drained soil, leading to the decay of roots and eventual plant death.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Wilting leaves, stunted growth, and blackened or mushy roots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Ensure pots have adequate drainage, and avoid waterlogged soil. Water sparingly and allow the soil to dry between watering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Cure:</strong> Remove affected plants, trim away diseased roots, and replant in fresh, well-draining soil. Use a natural fungicide like cinnamon powder on the roots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Cure:</strong> Treat the soil with a fungicide drench at the first sign of disease. Follow up with regular fungicide applications during the growing season.</li>
