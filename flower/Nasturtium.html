                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Nasturtiums thrive in cool to moderate temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They can tolerate light frosts but prefer milder conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Nasturtiums do best in full sun but can also tolerate partial shade. They require at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight each day to encourage robust flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> They are relatively adaptable to varying humidity levels but prefer average to low humidity environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation around Nasturtiums to prevent fungal diseases and support healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Nasturtiums are typically planted in spring after the last frost has passed. They can also be sown in late summer for a fall bloom.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Nasturtiums generally bloom from mid-summer to fall, offering vibrant color throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In colder climates, Nasturtiums may die back after the first frost. They do not usually require special care during dormancy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In colder regions, consider growing Nasturtiums in containers that can be moved indoors or providing frost protection to extend their growing season.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Nasturtiums prefer well-drained soil with good fertility. They thrive in a variety of soil types but do best in a loamy or sandy soil.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> They grow well in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain the appropriate pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Prepare the soil by incorporating organic matter or compost to enhance drainage and nutrient content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure containers have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Nasturtium plants or seeds from a reputable source. Look for vigorous seedlings or seeds with a high germination rate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 12-18 inches apart to allow for their mature size. Plant seeds about 1 inch deep or set seedlings at the same depth as their nursery containers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Proper planting depth ensures healthy root development and promotes vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to settle the soil and support plant establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to maintain even soil moisture. Nasturtiums prefer slightly dry conditions compared to some other plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Continue to maintain soil moisture during the flowering period to support vibrant blooms and healthy foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period or if plants are exposed to cold conditions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 20-20-20. Apply every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>

                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil before planting and use it as mulch to provide ongoing nutrients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Apply fish emulsion as a liquid feed every 4-6 weeks to enhance growth and flowering.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Use seaweed extract as a foliar spray or soil drench to improve plant health and resilience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal during planting to support root development and flowering.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the plant’s base to prevent burn. Water before and after applying fertilizer for best results.</li>
