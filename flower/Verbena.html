                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Verbena thrives in warm climates with temperatures between 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They are sensitive to frost and should be protected in colder weather.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Verbena needs full sun to part shade. Aim for at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day for the best flowering results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Verbena can tolerate moderate to low humidity. In very dry climates, occasional misting may be beneficial.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential to prevent fungal diseases and promote healthy plant growth.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Verbena is best planted in spring or early summer after the last frost has passed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Verbena generally blooms from late spring through fall, offering colorful flowers throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Verbena may die back in winter. Reduce watering and provide minimal care during this period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Verbena from frost and cold winds in winter. In colder regions, consider growing them as annuals or bringing potted plants indoors.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Verbena prefers well-drained soil rich in organic matter. A sandy loam with compost is ideal for optimal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Verbena grows best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain the proper pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter into the soil before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure containers have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Verbena plants or seedlings from a reputable source. Look for robust growth and vibrant foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 12-18 inches apart to allow for their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support strong root development and encourage vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to aid root establishment. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to maintain even soil moisture. Verbena prefers consistent moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture during the flowering period to support healthy blooms and foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
