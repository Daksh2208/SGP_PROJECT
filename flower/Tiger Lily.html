                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Tiger Lilies thrive in temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They are hardy plants that can withstand a range of climates but prefer cooler environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Tiger Lilies prefer full sun to partial shade. They need at least 6 hours of sunlight daily to produce vibrant blooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity is ideal for Tiger Lilies. They tolerate dry conditions but perform best with adequate moisture in the air.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation around Tiger Lilies to prevent fungal diseases and promote healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Tiger Lilies are best planted in spring or fall. Fall planting allows bulbs to establish roots before winter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Tiger Lilies bloom in mid to late summer, producing large, eye-catching flowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> After blooming, Tiger Lilies enter a dormant phase. Reduce watering and care during this period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In colder regions, mulch around the base of the plants to protect them from frost during winter.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Tiger Lilies prefer well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter. Sandy loam with added compost is ideal.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> They grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain the proper pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Amend the soil with organic matter before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with excellent drainage. Ensure pots have drainage holes to avoid waterlogging.</li>

                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and encourage vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
