            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Periwinkle thrives in moderate temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). They are sensitive to extreme cold and should be protected from frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Periwinkle prefers full sun to partial shade. Aim for at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight daily to encourage healthy growth and flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity levels are ideal for Periwinkle. They can tolerate dry conditions but may benefit from additional moisture during prolonged dry spells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is important to prevent fungal diseases and ensure vigorous growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Periwinkle is best planted in spring after the last frost. This allows the plant to establish itself before the warmer months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Periwinkle blooms from late spring to early fall, providing continuous color throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Periwinkle may enter a dormant phase during winter. Reduce watering and avoid excessive care during this time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Periwinkle from frost and cold winds in winter. In colder regions, consider bringing potted plants indoors or providing frost protection.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Periwinkle prefers well-drained soil enriched with organic matter. Loamy soil with added compost is ideal for optimal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Periwinkle grows best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain the appropriate pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Amend the soil with organic matter before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure containers have drainage holes to avoid waterlogging.</li>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Periwinkle plants or seeds from a reputable source. Look for robust foliage and strong stems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 12-18 inches apart to accommodate their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and promote vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to keep the soil evenly moist. Periwinkle plants need consistent moisture to thrive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture during the flowering period to ensure healthy blooms and foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
