            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Oxalis</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Oxalis thrive in moderate temperatures ranging from 15째C to 25째C (59째F to 77째F). They prefer a cool environment and can tolerate light frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Oxalis plants enjoy bright, indirect light. They can also adapt to partial shade but need some direct sunlight to maintain vibrant foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity is suitable for Oxalis. They can tolerate average indoor humidity levels but may benefit from occasional misting in dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is important to prevent mold and mildew, especially in indoor settings.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Oxalis can be planted in spring or fall, depending on your local climate. They adapt well to various seasons if the temperature conditions are met.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Many Oxalis species bloom from late winter to early spring, providing colorful flowers during the cooler months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Some Oxalis varieties may enter a dormant phase during the summer. During this time, reduce watering and allow the plant to rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> For indoor Oxalis, maintain regular care with reduced watering during dormancy. Outdoor plants may need protection from extreme heat or cold.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Oxalis prefers well-drained soil with a light texture. A mix of potting soil and sand or perlite works well for container plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> They grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain the optimal pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter into the soil to enhance drainage and fertility before planting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, ensure the pot has good drainage and use a high-quality potting mix with added perlite or sand.</li>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Oxalis bulbs or plants from a reputable source. Look for firm bulbs or vibrant foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space bulbs or plants 6-12 inches apart to allow for their natural spread. Plant bulbs at a depth of about 2 inches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth for healthy root development and successful growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and encourage root establishment.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting but avoid waterlogging, which can cause root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to maintain even moisture levels. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture to support flowering and foliage development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during dormancy. Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
                </ul>

                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal during planting and mid-season to support root development.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid applying fertilizer directly to the plant's base. Water before and after applying fertilizer for optimal results.</li>
