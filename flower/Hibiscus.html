            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Hibiscus</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Hibiscus thrive in warm temperatures ranging from 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F). They are sensitive to frost and should be protected from extreme cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Hibiscus plants need full sun to partial shade. They prefer at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily to encourage abundant flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> High humidity is beneficial for Hibiscus. They do well in humid environments and may need additional moisture in dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation around Hibiscus to prevent fungal diseases and promote healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Hibiscus are typically planted in spring or early summer when the risk of frost has passed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Hibiscus generally bloom from summer to fall, providing vibrant flowers throughout the growing season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> In cooler climates, Hibiscus may enter a dormant phase in winter. During this time, reduce watering and provide minimal care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> Protect Hibiscus from frost and cold winds in winter. In colder regions, consider bringing potted plants indoors or providing frost protection.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Hibiscus prefer well-drained soil rich in organic matter. A loamy soil with added compost is ideal for optimal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Hibiscus grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain the proper pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Amend the soil with organic matter before planting to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure pots have drainage holes to avoid waterlogging.</li>

                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Hibiscus plants or seeds from a reputable source. Look for vibrant foliage and strong stems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Space plants 24-36 inches apart to accommodate their mature size. Plant at the same depth as the nursery container or seedling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Ensure proper planting depth to support healthy root development and encourage vigorous growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and support the plant’s establishment.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist after planting to support root establishment. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to keep the soil evenly moist. Hibiscus plants need consistent moisture to thrive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain soil moisture during the flowering period to ensure healthy blooms and foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during the dormant period, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
