            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Evening Primrose thrives in temperatures between 18째C to 28째C (64째F to 82째F). It prefers mild climates and can tolerate a range of conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Evening Primrose requires full sun to partial shade. It grows best with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity levels (50-70%) are ideal. The plant is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal infections. Avoid overcrowded planting to allow for airflow.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Evening Primrose is typically planted in spring or early summer to allow it to establish before the flowering season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Evening Primrose usually blooms from late spring to early autumn, providing a prolonged display of flowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Evening Primrose may go dormant in winter, with foliage dying back. During this period, they require minimal care.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In regions with harsh winters, mulch around the base to protect the plant from freezing temperatures.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Evening Primrose prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soil. It is adaptable to different soil types but performs best in soil with good drainage.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for Evening Primrose. Soil testing can help achieve the proper pH.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Loosen the soil before planting and mix in compost or other organic material to improve drainage and fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> If planting in containers, ensure they have good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot.</li>
