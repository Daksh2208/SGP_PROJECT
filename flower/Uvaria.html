                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Uvaria thrives in warm climates with temperatures between 20째C to 30째C (68째F to 86째F). They are sensitive to frost and should be protected from cold.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Uvaria plants need full sun to partial shade. They require at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight each day to grow well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate to high humidity is preferred. Uvaria benefits from increased moisture in dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential to prevent fungal diseases and ensure healthy growth.</li>
