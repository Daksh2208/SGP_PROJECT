            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Iris</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Iris plants thrive in temperate climates with cool to moderate temperatures. Ideal temperature ranges from 10째C to 25째C (50째F to 77째F).</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Iris prefers full sun exposure, requiring at least 6 hours of sunlight daily to produce abundant flowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Moderate humidity levels are best for Iris. In extremely humid areas, ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal diseases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is crucial for Iris plants to prevent rot and fungal infections, especially in damp conditions.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Plant Iris rhizomes in late summer or early fall to establish roots before winter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Iris typically blooms in spring, providing a stunning display of flowers during this season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Iris plants enter dormancy in winter, where growth slows down. Minimal care is needed during this time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In colder climates, protect Iris rhizomes from frost by applying mulch. In warmer regions, ensure they are not exposed to excessive heat.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Iris prefers well-drained soil, such as sandy or loamy soil. Avoid heavy clay soils that retain too much moisture.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Iris thrives in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Adjust soil pH if necessary using lime or sulfur.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Prepare the soil by loosening it and incorporating compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> When growing Iris in containers, use a well-draining potting mix and ensure pots have adequate drainage holes.</li>

            <h2>Planting and Care</h2>
            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plant Selection:</strong> Choose healthy Iris rhizomes or potted plants from a reliable source. Look for firm, disease-free rhizomes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Plant rhizomes horizontally, just below the soil surface, with the tops slightly exposed. Space them 12-24 inches apart.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Plant rhizomes shallowly, ensuring they are not buried too deep, as this can hinder flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and establish roots. Avoid overwatering.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Water regularly after planting, keeping the soil moist but not waterlogged until the plants are established.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> During the growing season, water Iris plants moderately, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Maintain consistent moisture during the blooming period to support healthy flower development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering during dormancy in winter, especially in areas with high rainfall or cold temperatures.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="fertilizer">
                <h3>6. Fertilizer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with a lower nitrogen ratio, such as 5-10-10, applied in early spring before flowering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Fertilizers:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Incorporate compost into the soil in early spring to provide essential nutrients and improve soil structure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Apply bone meal at planting time and in early spring to encourage strong root and flower development.</li>
                            <li><strong>Organic Mulch:</strong> Use organic mulch around the plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and gradually release nutrients.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Application Tips:</strong> Avoid over-fertilizing, as too much nitrogen can lead to excessive leaf growth at the expense of flowers. Water well after fertilizing.</li>

            <article id="rhizome-rot">
                <h3>7. Rhizome Rot</h3>
                <p>Rhizome rot is a common issue in Iris plants, caused by overly wet or poorly drained soil, leading to soft, decaying rhizomes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Soft, mushy rhizomes with a foul odor; yellowing leaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Ensure well-drained soil and avoid overwatering. Plant rhizomes slightly above soil level to improve drainage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Cure:</strong> Remove and discard affected rhizomes. Treat remaining healthy rhizomes with a fungicide and replant in well-drained soil.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Cure:</strong> Apply a fungicide containing thiophanate-methyl or captan to prevent and treat rhizome rot. Follow the label instructions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>8. Leaf Spot</h3>
                <p>Leaf spot is a fungal disease that causes dark spots on Iris leaves, potentially leading to defoliation if untreated.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Dark, circular spots on leaves, often with a yellow halo.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Water at the base of the plants and avoid overhead watering. Ensure good air circulation to keep foliage dry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Cure:</strong> Remove and destroy affected leaves. Apply a baking soda spray (1 tablespoon per gallon of water) to affected areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical Cure:</strong> Use a fungicide containing chlorothalonil or copper-based products to control leaf spot. Follow label directions for application.</li>
