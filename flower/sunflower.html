                <h3>Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Sunflowers thrive in warm climates with temperatures ranging between 18째C to 30째C (65째F to 85째F). They are sensitive to frost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Full sunlight is essential for sunflowers. They need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day to grow optimally.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Sunflowers are typically planted in late spring after the danger of frost has passed. In cooler climates, aim to plant in early to mid-spring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Sunflowers usually flower in late summer to early fall, approximately 70 to 90 days after planting, depending on the variety.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="soil">
                <h3>Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Sunflowers prefer well-drained, loamy soil. They are adaptable but perform best in soil that is rich in organic matter.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal for sunflowers. They can tolerate slightly alkaline conditions but perform best in neutral to slightly acidic soil.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Compost, aged manure, and bone meal. These add essential nutrients and improve soil structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inorganic Fertilizers:</strong> Balanced NPK fertilizers with a ratio like 10-10-10 or 14-14-14. Sunflowers benefit from phosphorus-rich fertilizers during the flowering stage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fertilization Schedule</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pre-Planting:</strong> Incorporate a balanced fertilizer or compost into the soil before planting to provide essential nutrients.</li>
                    <li><strong>Early Growth:</strong> Apply a high-nitrogen fertilizer to support strong vegetative growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pre-Flowering:</strong> Use a phosphorus-rich fertilizer to enhance flower development.</li>
                    <li><strong>During Flowering:</strong> A balanced fertilizer can help maintain overall plant health and yield.</li>
