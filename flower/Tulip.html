            <h2>Optimal Growing Conditions for Tulips</h2>
            <article id="climate">
                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Tulips thrive in cool to temperate climates, with temperatures ranging from 10째C to 20째C (50째F to 68째F). They require a period of cold dormancy to flower effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Tulips prefer full sun to partial shade. They need at least 4-6 hours of sunlight daily for healthy growth and blooming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Tulips generally do well in moderate humidity. They are not highly sensitive to humidity but should be protected from overly wet conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation helps prevent fungal diseases and supports healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="season">
                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Tulips are typically planted in the fall, around September to November, before the ground freezes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Tulips generally bloom in early to mid-spring, depending on the variety and local climate conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> After flowering, Tulips enter a dormant phase. Allow the foliage to die back naturally before removing it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In colder climates, mulch can be added to protect Tulip bulbs during the winter. In warmer regions, bulbs may need to be lifted and stored until the next planting season.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="soil">
                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Tulips prefer well-drained soil with good organic content. A sandy loam or loamy soil is ideal for optimal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Tulips grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Regular soil testing can help maintain the appropriate pH level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Prepare the soil by incorporating compost or well-rotted manure to enhance fertility and drainage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use a high-quality potting mix with good drainage. Ensure pots have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.</li>

            <article id="planting">
                <h3>4. Planting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bulb Selection:</strong> Choose healthy, firm Tulip bulbs from a reputable source. Avoid bulbs with mold or soft spots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Plant Tulip bulbs 6-8 inches deep and 4-6 inches apart to accommodate their mature size.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Planting:</strong> Proper planting depth supports robust root development and helps prevent diseases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Watering:</strong> Water thoroughly after planting to help settle the soil and promote root growth.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article id="watering">
                <h3>5. Watering</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Keep the soil evenly moist after planting. Avoid overwatering, which can cause bulb rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth Stage:</strong> Water regularly during the growing season to maintain consistent soil moisture. Avoid getting water on the foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Stage:</strong> Continue to water during flowering to support healthy blooms and foliage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dormancy Stage:</strong> Reduce watering once the foliage starts to yellow and die back, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.</li>
                </ul>
