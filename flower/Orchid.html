                <h3>1. Climate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Orchids generally thrive in moderate temperatures ranging from 18°C to 24°C (65°F to 75°F). They are sensitive to extreme temperatures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Light:</strong> Orchids require bright, indirect light. They can tolerate some direct sunlight but should be protected from harsh midday sun.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> High humidity is crucial for Orchids. They prefer humidity levels between 40% and 70% and may require additional moisture in dry conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is essential to prevent fungal diseases and to promote healthy growth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Season</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planting Season:</strong> Orchids can be planted or repotted year-round, but spring and early summer are ideal for growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flowering Season:</strong> Orchid flowering varies by species, but many bloom during winter or early spring, providing beautiful flowers during colder months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting Period:</strong> Some Orchids enter a resting period after blooming. During this time, reduce watering and allow the plant to rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-Season Care:</strong> In colder regions, ensure Orchids are kept in a warm environment and protected from frost.</li>

                <h3>3. Soil</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Orchids prefer well-drained, airy media. Use orchid mix or bark-based potting media to ensure proper drainage.</li>
                    <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Orchids thrive in slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 5.5 to 6.5.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Ensure the potting media is fresh and well-aerated to prevent root rot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Container Use:</strong> For container planting, use pots with drainage holes to avoid waterlogging and root damage.</li>
