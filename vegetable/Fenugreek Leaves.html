            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Fenugreek Leaves</h2>
            <img src="Fenugreek-Leaves(Methi).jpg" alt="Fenugreek Planting">
            <p>Fenugreek leaves thrive in cooler weather. The ideal growing seasons are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Fenugreek can be sown in early spring as the soil warms up. It grows best when temperatures are between 60-70째F (15-21째C).</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> In warmer climates, fenugreek can be planted in late summer or early fall for a late-season harvest.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="soil">
            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Fenugreek prefers well-drained, loamy soil. It can tolerate a variety of soil types but performs best in loamy soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Fenugreek thrives in a neutral to slightly alkaline soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter such as compost to improve soil fertility and drainage.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="fertilizer">
            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Fenugreek Leaves</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced NPK fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 to ensure adequate nutrient supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Compost and well-rotted manure are excellent for providing a balanced supply of nutrients and improving soil structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Nitrogen:</strong> Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers as they can lead to excessive leaf growth at the expense of flavor.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="diseases">
            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Fenugreek Leaves</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> White, powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve air circulation and apply fungicides if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Brown or black spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove affected leaves and avoid overhead watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Caused by overwatering or poorly-drained soil. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Aphids:</strong> Small, sap-sucking insects that can weaken plants. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticidal soap or introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultural-practices">
            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate crops to prevent disease buildup. Avoid planting fenugreek in the same spot each year to reduce disease risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and affected plant parts to minimize pathogen spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Water at the base of the plants to keep foliage dry and reduce the risk of fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties to improve plant health and decrease disease incidence.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Fenugreek grows best in cooler temperatures between 60-70째F (15-21째C). It can tolerate light frost but may not survive extreme cold.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Fenugreek does not require excessive watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 4-6 inches apart to allow for proper air circulation and prevent overcrowding.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Regularly inspect plants for pests such as aphids and mites. Use organic pest control methods or introduce beneficial insects if needed.</li>
