            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Radish</h2>

            <p>Radishes are fast-growing root vegetables that can be planted in several seasons. Here’s how to manage their growing seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Radishes are ideal for early spring planting. Sow seeds directly into the soil 2-4 weeks before the last frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Radishes can be grown in summer with adequate water and some shade during the hottest part of the day.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Radishes can be grown in the fall for a late harvest. Sow seeds 6-8 weeks before the first expected frost.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Radishes prefer well-drained, loose soil. Loamy or sandy loam soil is ideal for proper root development.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for radishes is between 6.0 and 7.0, which is slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost to improve fertility and ensure proper drainage.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure to provide steady nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Nutrients:</strong> Radishes benefit from additional potassium. Consider using a fertilizer with higher potassium levels.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Causes decay of the radish roots. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure good drainage and avoid overwatering.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Leads to yellowing and downy white growth on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and ensure good air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Dark spots on leaves that can lead to leaf drop. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove infected leaves and apply fungicides as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Clubroot:</strong> Causes swelling and distortion of roots. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and avoid planting in infected soil.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?radish,care" alt="Care for Radish">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Radishes grow best in temperatures between 50-70°F (10-21°C). They can tolerate light frosts but prefer cool conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Radishes require regular watering, especially during dry periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Radishes need full sun or partial shade. Provide some shade during the hottest part of the day to prevent bolting.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like aphids and root maggots. Use organic pest control methods if needed.</li>
