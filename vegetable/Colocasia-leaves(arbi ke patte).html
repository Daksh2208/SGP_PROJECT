            <p>Colocasia leaves, also known as Arbi, thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The ideal growing seasons are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Ideal for planting in tropical regions where temperatures are consistently warm and there is ample rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Continue growing during hot months. Ensure regular watering and protection from extreme heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Harvest mature leaves before the onset of colder temperatures. Ensure soil remains well-drained to prevent root rot.</li>
            </ul>
