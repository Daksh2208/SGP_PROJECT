            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Lettuce</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?lettuce,planting" alt="Lettuce Planting">
            <p>Lettuce is a cool-season crop that thrives in mild temperatures. Here’s how to manage its growing seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Ideal for planting lettuce as it prefers cooler weather. Start seeds indoors or directly sow outdoors 2-4 weeks before the last frost date.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Lettuce can be grown in summer with some shade to prevent bolting. Choose heat-tolerant varieties if planting in warmer climates.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Lettuce can be grown in the fall for a late harvest. Sow seeds 8-10 weeks before the first expected frost.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,lettuce" alt="Soil for Lettuce">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Lettuce prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Sandy loam is ideal as it provides good drainage and aeration.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for lettuce is between 6.0 and 7.0, which is slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Lettuce</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,lettuce" alt="Fertilizer for Lettuce">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure to provide steady nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Nutrients:</strong> Lettuce benefits from additional calcium to prevent tip burn. Consider using lime or a calcium supplement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Lettuce</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Causes yellowing and downy white growth on the underside of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and ensure good air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Leads to dark, sunken spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove infected leaves and apply fungicides as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> White, powdery growth on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and avoid overhead watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Bolting:</strong> Premature flowering caused by high temperatures. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Choose bolt-resistant varieties and provide shade in hot climates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?lettuce,culture" alt="Cultural Practices for Lettuce">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Avoid planting lettuce in the same location year after year. Rotate crops to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and weeds that can harbor diseases. Clean gardening tools regularly to prevent disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Management:</strong> Use raised beds or containers to improve drainage and avoid soil-borne pathogens. Regularly check for soil health and amend as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Practices:</strong> Water the base of plants rather than overhead to minimize leaf wetness and reduce disease risk.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?lettuce,care" alt="Care for Lettuce">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Lettuce grows best in temperatures between 50-70°F (10-21°C). It can tolerate light frosts but prefers cool conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Lettuce requires regular watering, especially in warm weather.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Lettuce needs full sun or partial shade. Provide some shade during hot weather to prevent bolting.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like aphids and slugs. Use organic pest control methods if needed.</li>
            </ul>
