            <img src="Potatoes.jpg" alt="Potatoes Planting">
            <p>Potatoes thrive in cooler weather. Here’s how to manage its growing seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Ideal time to plant potatoes. Prepare the soil 2-4 weeks before the last frost date and plant when the soil temperature is around 45°F (7°C).</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Potatoes require consistent moisture during the growing season. Ensure adequate watering and watch for signs of disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Harvest potatoes after the foliage dies back and before the first frost. Cure potatoes in a cool, dry place before storage.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="soil">
            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Potatoes prefer well-drained, loose soil. Sandy loam or loamy soil is ideal for good root development.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for potatoes is between 5.0 and 6.0, slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="fertilizer">
            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Potatoes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure to provide steady nutrients throughout the growing season.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Nutrients:</strong> Potatoes benefit from additional potassium and phosphorus. Consider using bone meal or potassium sulfate as needed.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="diseases">
            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Potatoes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Late Blight:</strong> Causes dark lesions on leaves and stems. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and avoid overhead watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Early Blight:</strong> Leads to dark spots on leaves and premature leaf drop. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and rotate crops to reduce incidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Potato Scab:</strong> Results in rough, scabby lesions on tubers. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper soil pH and use disease-resistant varieties.</li>
                <li><strong>Common Scab:</strong> Affects tubers, causing scabby lesions. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve soil drainage and use clean seed potatoes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultural-practices">
            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate potatoes with non-nightshade crops to prevent soil-borne diseases and reduce pest pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy plant debris and weeds regularly. Clean and disinfect gardening tools to prevent disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Use drip irrigation to minimize moisture on foliage and reduce the risk of fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Choose potato varieties that are resistant to common diseases in your region.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Potatoes grow best in temperatures between 60-70°F (15-21°C). They can tolerate light frosts, but severe frost can damage the crop.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Maintain consistent soil moisture. Avoid waterlogging and allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Potatoes require full sun for optimal growth. Ensure they receive at least 6-8 hours of sunlight daily.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like Colorado potato beetles and aphids. Use organic pest control methods and keep plants healthy to deter pests.</li>
