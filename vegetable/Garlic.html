            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Garlic</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?garlic,planting" alt="Garlic Planting">
            <p>Garlic is a hardy plant that thrives in cool to moderate climates. The ideal growing seasons for garlic are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fall Planting:</strong> In temperate climates, plant garlic in the fall, about 4-6 weeks before the first frost. This allows the garlic to establish roots before winter.</li>
                <li><strong>Spring Planting:</strong> In regions with mild winters, garlic can be planted in early spring as soon as the soil can be worked.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,garlic" alt="Soil for Garlic">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Garlic prefers well-drained, loamy soil that is rich in organic matter. Sandy loam is ideal as it provides good drainage and aeration.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for garlic is between 6.0 and 7.0. Ensure the soil is slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Add compost or well-rotted manure to the soil to enhance fertility and improve structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 5-10-10 to promote overall plant growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Compost and aged manure provide essential nutrients and improve soil health.</li>
                <li><strong>High Phosphorus Fertilizers:</strong> Bone meal or rock phosphate can enhance bulb development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Garlic</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?garlic,disease" alt="Diseases in Garlic">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Caused by the fungus <em>Peronospora destructor</em>. Symptoms include yellowing and curling of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and ensure proper air circulation around plants.</li>
                <li><strong>White Rot:</strong> Caused by the fungus <em>Sclerotium cepivorum</em>. Symptoms include rotting of bulbs and white fungal growth at the base. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Practice crop rotation and avoid planting garlic in the same location for consecutive years.</li>
                <li><strong>Rust:</strong> Caused by the fungus <em>Puccinia allii</em>. Symptoms include reddish-brown pustules on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plants and use appropriate fungicides.</li>
                <li><strong>Garlic Mosaic Virus:</strong> Causes mottled leaves and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use virus-free seeds and avoid handling plants when wet.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate crops to prevent the buildup of diseases and pests in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity around foliage.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and dispose of plant debris and affected plant parts to minimize disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Water at the base of the plants to keep foliage dry and prevent fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties to enhance plant health and reduce disease incidence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?garlic,care" alt="Care for Garlic">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Garlic grows best in temperatures between 55-75°F (13-24°C). Protect plants from extreme heat and cold.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Garlic requires regular watering, especially during dry periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space garlic cloves 6-8 inches apart in rows 12-18 inches apart to allow for proper bulb development.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and onion flies. Use organic pest control methods or introduce beneficial insects.</li>
