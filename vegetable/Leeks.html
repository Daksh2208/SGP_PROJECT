            <p>Leeks are a cool-season vegetable that can be grown in various climates. They have a long growing period, so planning is essential:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Start seeds indoors 8-10 weeks before the last frost date. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the danger of frost has passed.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Direct sow seeds outdoors in mid-summer for a fall harvest, especially in regions with mild winters.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> In milder climates, leeks can be grown through the fall and harvested into winter.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Leeks prefer well-drained, fertile soil. Loamy soil with good organic content is ideal.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for leeks is between 6.0 and 7.0. Slightly acidic to neutral soil is best.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate plenty of compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and drainage.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure for a steady supply of nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen:</strong> Leeks benefit from additional nitrogen during their growing season to promote robust leaf growth. Consider using a fish emulsion or blood meal.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Causes yellowing and curling of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and ensure good air circulation around plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Rust:</strong> Leads to orange or yellow pustules on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove infected leaves and apply fungicides as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>White Rot:</strong> Causes root and bulb decay. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Avoid planting in infected soil and practice crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Leads to dark spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and practice good garden hygiene.</li>

            <h2>5. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?leeks,care" alt="Care for Leeks">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Leeks grow best in cooler temperatures between 55-75°F (13-24°C). They can tolerate light frosts but prefer mild climates.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Regular watering is essential for proper bulb development.</li>
                <li><strong>Blanching:</strong> To achieve long, tender white stems, blanch leeks by hilling soil around the base or using special blanching collars.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like leek moths and root maggots. Use organic pesticides or traps to manage infestations.</li>
