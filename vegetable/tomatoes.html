            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Tomatoes</h2>
            <img src="tomatoes.jpg" alt="Tomato Planting">
            <p>Tomatoes thrive in warm weather. The ideal growing seasons for tomatoes are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost date. Transplant them outdoors after the danger of frost has passed.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> In regions with a long growing season, you can plant tomatoes directly outdoors in early summer.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Tomatoes prefer well-drained, loamy soil. Sandy loam is ideal as it provides good drainage and aeration.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Slightly acidic to neutral soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8 is optimal.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure into the soil to improve fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Tomatoes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 5-5-5.</li>
                <li><strong>Nitrogen:</strong> High nitrogen levels promote foliage growth. However, too much nitrogen can hinder fruit production.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus:</strong> Important for root development and fruit set. Bone meal is a good source.</li>
                <li><strong>Potassium:</strong> Enhances overall plant health and disease resistance. Potassium sulfate or wood ash can be used.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Organic Options:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Provides a balanced supply of nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Rich in nitrogen, promotes healthy foliage.</li>
                <li><strong>Seaweed Extract:</strong> Contains trace minerals that improve overall plant health.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Tomatoes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Blight:</strong> Caused by the fungus <em>Alternaria solani</em>. Symptoms include dark spots on leaves, stems, and fruit. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides, practice crop rotation, and ensure proper spacing for air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Late Blight:</strong> Caused by <em>Phytophthora infestans</em>. Symptoms include water-soaked lesions on leaves and fruit. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides, remove infected plants, and avoid overhead watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Fusarium Wilt:</strong> Caused by the fungus <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em>. Symptoms include yellowing and wilting of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Plant resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, and improve soil drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>Tomato Mosaic Virus:</strong> Causes mottled leaves and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use virus-free seeds, practice good sanitation, and avoid handling plants when wet.</li>
                <li><strong>Blossom End Rot:</strong> Caused by calcium deficiency and irregular watering. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Maintain consistent soil moisture and apply calcium supplements.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate crops to avoid planting tomatoes in the same location for consecutive years.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Ensure adequate spacing between plants to promote air circulation and reduce humidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Mulching:</strong> Apply mulch to conserve soil moisture, suppress weeds, and prevent soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Remove lower leaves and suckers to improve air circulation and reduce disease risk.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Optimal daytime temperatures are 70-85째F (21-29째C) and nighttime temperatures are 60-70째F (15-21째C).</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Provide consistent moisture, watering deeply and regularly. Avoid overhead watering to reduce disease risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Staking and Support:</strong> Use stakes, cages, or trellises to support the plants and keep fruit off the ground.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests such as aphids, tomato hornworms, and whiteflies. Use organic pesticides or introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs.</li>
