            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Green Chilies</h2>
            <img src="Green-chillies.jpg" alt="Green Chilies Planting">
            <p>Green chilies are warm-season crops that require consistent warmth to thrive. The ideal growing seasons include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Start seeds indoors 8-10 weeks before the last frost date. Transplant seedlings outdoors after the risk of frost has passed.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Direct sow seeds outdoors once the soil temperature is consistently above 70째F (21째C). Ensure a sunny location for optimal growth.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="soil">
            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Chilies prefer well-drained, loamy soil with good organic matter. Sandy loam or clay loam are suitable options.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for green chilies is between 6.0 and 6.8. Slightly acidic to neutral soil is best.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure to enhance soil fertility and improve drainage.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="fertilizer">
            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Green Chilies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 to support healthy growth.</li>
                <li><strong>High Potassium Fertilizers:</strong> Potassium helps improve fruit quality and resistance to diseases. Use a fertilizer with a higher potassium ratio.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Compost, well-rotted manure, and fish emulsion are excellent organic fertilizers that provide a range of nutrients.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="diseases">
            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Green Chilies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Caused by fungal pathogens, resulting in dark spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and ensure proper spacing for air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> Fungal disease causing white, powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and avoid overhead watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Phytophthora Blight:</strong> Caused by soil-borne fungi, leading to wilting and rot. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve soil drainage and use resistant varieties.</li>
                <li><strong>Chili Mosaic Virus:</strong> Causes mottled leaves and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use virus-free seeds and practice good sanitation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultural-practices">
            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate crops to prevent the buildup of diseases and pests in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity around foliage.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and dispose of plant debris and affected plant parts to minimize disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Water at the base of the plants to keep foliage dry and prevent fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties to enhance plant health and reduce disease incidence.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Green chilies grow best in temperatures between 70-85째F (21-29째C). Protect plants from frost and extreme temperatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water deeply and regularly, especially during dry periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Use stakes or cages to support the plants as they grow, especially for taller varieties.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests such as aphids, spider mites, and whiteflies. Use organic pesticides or introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs.</li>
