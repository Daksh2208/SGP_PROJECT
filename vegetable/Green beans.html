            <p>Green beans are warm-season crops that thrive in temperatures between 70-85°F (21-29°C). Ideal growing seasons include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Sow seeds directly outdoors after the last frost. Beans prefer warm soil, so wait until soil temperatures are consistently above 60°F (15°C).</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Beans can be planted in summer for a second harvest. Ensure they receive full sunlight and consistent moisture.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,beans" alt="Soil for Green Beans">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Green beans prefer well-drained, loamy soil with good organic content. Sandy loam is ideal.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for green beans is between 6.0 and 7.0. Slightly acidic to neutral soil is preferred.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter such as compost into the soil to improve fertility and drainage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Green Beans</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,beans" alt="Fertilizer for Green Beans">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Compost and aged manure provide essential nutrients and improve soil structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Nitrogen Fertilizers:</strong> Beans fix their own nitrogen, so avoid high nitrogen fertilizers that can lead to excessive foliage growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> Caused by fungal spores. Symptoms include white powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and ensure proper spacing for air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Bean Rust:</strong> Caused by the fungus <em>Uromyces appendiculatus</em>. Symptoms include reddish-brown pustules on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and remove infected plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Bacterial Blight:</strong> Caused by the bacterium <em>Xanthomonas campestris</em>. Symptoms include water-soaked lesions on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and practice crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Caused by various fungi. Symptoms include wilting and root decay. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve soil drainage and avoid overwatering.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate crops to prevent the buildup of diseases and pests in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity around foliage.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and dispose of plant debris and affected plant parts to minimize disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Water at the base of the plants to keep foliage dry and prevent fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties to enhance plant health and reduce disease incidence.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?beans,care" alt="Care for Green Beans">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Green beans thrive in temperatures between 70-85°F (21-29°C). Protect plants from frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water deeply during dry periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> For pole beans, provide trellises or stakes for support. Bush beans generally do not require support.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests such as aphids and spider mites. Use organic pesticides or introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs.</li>
