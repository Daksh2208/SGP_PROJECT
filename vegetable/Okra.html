            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Okra</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?okra,planting" alt="Okra Planting">
            <p>Okra is a warm-season vegetable that thrives in hot weather. Here’s how to manage its growing seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Ideal for planting okra as it needs warm soil to germinate. Start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last frost or sow directly outdoors after the risk of frost has passed.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Okra grows best in hot summer weather. Ensure consistent watering and provide plenty of sunlight.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Okra can be harvested into the fall, but be sure to pick pods before frost arrives.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Okra prefers well-drained, sandy loam soil that is rich in organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for okra is between 6.0 and 7.0, which is slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Improve soil fertility with compost or well-rotted manure before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 to promote healthy growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or aged manure to maintain soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Nutrients:</strong> Okra may benefit from additional potassium and phosphorus to enhance pod production.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> Causes white, powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and improve air circulation around plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Affects roots, causing wilting and yellowing. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Avoid overwatering and ensure good soil drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>Okra Mosaic Virus:</strong> Causes mottled leaves and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove infected plants and control aphid populations.</li>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?okra,culture" alt="Cultural Practices for Okra">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate okra with other non-solanaceous crops to prevent soil-borne diseases and reduce pest buildup.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity, which helps prevent fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and weeds regularly. Disinfect gardening tools and equipment to minimize disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Use drip irrigation to avoid overhead watering and reduce the risk of diseases that thrive in wet conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Choose okra varieties that are resistant to common diseases and pests in your area.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Okra thrives in temperatures between 75-95°F (24-35°C). It requires warm conditions for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Okra needs regular watering, especially in dry conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Okra requires full sun for at least 6-8 hours a day. Ensure plants receive ample sunlight for strong growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic pest control methods if needed.</li>
