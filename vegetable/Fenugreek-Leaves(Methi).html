            <p>Fenugreek leaves thrive in cooler weather. The ideal growing seasons are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Fenugreek can be sown in early spring as the soil warms up. It grows best when temperatures are between 60-70째F (15-21째C).</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> In warmer climates, fenugreek can be planted in late summer or early fall for a late-season harvest.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Fenugreek prefers well-drained, loamy soil. It can tolerate a variety of soil types but performs best in loamy soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Fenugreek thrives in a neutral to slightly alkaline soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter such as compost to improve soil fertility and drainage.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?fertilizer,fenugreek" alt="Fertilizer for Fenugreek Leaves">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced NPK fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 to ensure adequate nutrient supply.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Compost and well-rotted manure are excellent for providing a balanced supply of nutrients and improving soil structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Nitrogen:</strong> Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers as they can lead to excessive leaf growth at the expense of flavor.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Fenugreek grows best in cooler temperatures between 60-70째F (15-21째C). It can tolerate light frost but may not survive extreme cold.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Fenugreek does not require excessive watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 4-6 inches apart to allow for proper air circulation and prevent overcrowding.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Regularly inspect plants for pests such as aphids and mites. Use organic pest control methods or introduce beneficial insects if needed.</li>
