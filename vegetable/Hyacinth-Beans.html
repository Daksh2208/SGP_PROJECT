            <p>Hyacinth beans thrive in warm climates and are typically grown in the following seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Start planting after the last frost date, as hyacinth beans prefer warm soil temperatures to germinate.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> In regions with long growing seasons, you can continue planting in early summer to harvest in late summer to fall.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Hyacinth beans prefer well-drained, loamy soil. Sandy loam or clay loam works best for good drainage and root development.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Ideal soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.5. Hyacinth beans can tolerate slightly acidic to alkaline soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Improve soil fertility by incorporating organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 for overall plant health.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus:</strong> Essential for root development. Bone meal or a phosphorus-rich fertilizer is recommended.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Compost and well-rotted manure provide essential nutrients and improve soil structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> White, powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and improve air circulation around plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Rust:</strong> Orange-brown pustules on leaves and stems. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and remove affected plant debris.</li>
                <li><strong>Bean Mosaic Virus:</strong> Causes mottling and distortion of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use virus-free seeds and practice crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Caused by fungal pathogens in wet soil. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure well-drained soil and avoid overwatering.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?beans,care" alt="Care for Hyacinth Beans">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Hyacinth beans grow best in temperatures between 70-85°F (21-29°C). They need warm temperatures for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water deeply and regularly, but avoid waterlogging. Allow the soil to dry out between watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Provide support for climbing varieties with trellises or stakes to keep plants upright and promote better air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic pesticides or introduce beneficial insects to manage pests.</li>
