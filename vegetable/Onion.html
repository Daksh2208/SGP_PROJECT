            <p>Onions can be grown year-round in many climates. Here’s how to manage their growing seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Onions can be started indoors or directly sown outdoors. Ideal for regions with cold winters.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> In warmer climates, onions can be grown through the summer. Ensure regular watering to prevent bulb splitting.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Onions can be planted in the fall for a late harvest. Mulch to protect from frost in colder areas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,onion" alt="Soil for Onions">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Onions prefer well-drained, loamy soil. Sandy loam is ideal as it ensures good drainage and aeration.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for onions is between 6.0 and 7.0, which is slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure to provide steady nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Nutrients:</strong> Onions benefit from additional sulfur to enhance bulb development. Consider using a sulfur-based fertilizer.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Causes yellowing and white mold on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and ensure good air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Onion Rust:</strong> Leads to reddish-brown pustules on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove infected leaves and use fungicides if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Fusarium Basal Rot:</strong> Causes rot at the base of the plant. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid overwatering.</li>
                <li><strong>Botrytis Neck Rot:</strong> Causes soft rot at the neck of the bulb. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Harvest onions when dry and store in a well-ventilated area.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate onions with non-allium crops to prevent soil-borne diseases and reduce pest pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Provide adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy plant debris and weeds regularly. Clean and disinfect gardening tools to prevent disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Use drip irrigation to minimize moisture on leaves and reduce the risk of fungal diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Choose onion varieties that are resistant to common diseases in your region.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Onions grow best in temperatures between 55-75°F (13-24°C). They can tolerate light frosts but prefer cooler conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Onions require regular watering, especially during dry spells.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Onions need full sun for optimal growth. Ensure they receive at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like onion flies and thrips. Use organic pest control methods if needed.</li>
