            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Celery</h2>
            <img src="/vegetable/celery_planting.jpg" alt="Celery Planting">
            <p>Celery is a cool-season crop that requires a long growing season. The ideal growing seasons are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Start seeds indoors 10-12 weeks before the last frost. Transplant outdoors once the soil has warmed and frost danger has passed.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Continue growing through the summer. Provide adequate water and mulch to retain soil moisture and reduce heat stress.</li>
                <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Harvest before the first hard frost. Celery can be left in the ground in milder climates, but it's best to harvest before frost hits.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <img src="/vegetable/celery_soil.jpg" alt="Soil for Celery">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Prefers rich, well-drained, loamy soil with a good amount of organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Optimal pH is between 6.0 and 7.0.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or aged manure to improve soil fertility and texture. Ensure soil is well-drained but capable of holding moisture.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Celery</h2>
            <img src="/vegetable/Fertilizer_Celery.jpeg" alt="Fertilizer for Celery">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>High Nitrogen:</strong> Celery has high nitrogen needs for robust leaf growth. Use fertilizers high in nitrogen like urea or ammonium nitrate.</li>
                <li><strong>Calcium:</strong> Essential for cell wall strength and preventing disorders. Use calcium-rich fertilizers like calcium nitrate or gypsum.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Organic Options:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Provides essential nutrients and improves soil structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Supplies nitrogen and other essential nutrients for vigorous growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Adds phosphorus and calcium to the soil, aiding in root development.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Celery Rust:</strong> Brownish spots with a rusty appearance on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve air circulation and apply appropriate fungicides.</li>
                <li><strong>Blight:</strong> Causes wilting and browning of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Avoid overhead watering and remove affected plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Small, dark spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties and apply fungicides as needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <img src="/vegetable/celery_care.jpg" alt="Care for Celery">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Optimal temperatures are between 60-70°F (15-21°C). Celery is sensitive to high temperatures and frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Celery requires regular watering to prevent stress.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants about 6-8 inches apart to allow for proper growth and air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and cutworms. Use organic pest control methods if needed.</li>
