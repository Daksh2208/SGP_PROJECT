            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Rocket Leaves</h2>

            <p>Rocket leaves, also known as arugula, thrive in cooler weather. Here’s how to manage its growing seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Start sowing seeds in early spring for a fresh spring harvest.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Rocket can be grown in summer with some shade to prevent bolting. Choose heat-tolerant varieties if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Sow seeds in late summer or early fall for a fall or winter harvest. Rocket leaves can tolerate light frosts.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Sandy loam is ideal for good drainage and aeration.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for rocket leaves is between 6.0 and 7.0, which is slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure to provide steady nutrients and improve soil health.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Nutrients:</strong> Rocket leaves benefit from a dose of nitrogen to encourage lush leaf growth. Consider using a nitrogen-rich fertilizer or compost.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Causes yellow spots and downy white growth on the underside of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and ensure good air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> White powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and avoid overhead watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Dark, sunken spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove infected leaves and apply fungicides as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Bolting:</strong> Premature flowering caused by high temperatures. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Choose bolt-resistant varieties and provide shade during hot weather.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Avoid planting rocket leaves in the same spot year after year to prevent soil-borne diseases and nutrient depletion.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to ensure good air circulation and reduce the risk of diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Mulching:</strong> Apply mulch to retain soil moisture and regulate soil temperature. This helps in maintaining consistent growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Thinning:</strong> Thin out seedlings if they are too crowded to allow for proper growth and prevent competition for nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Harvesting:</strong> Harvest leaves regularly to encourage continuous growth and prevent the plant from bolting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?rocket-leaves,care" alt="Care for Rocket Leaves">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Rocket leaves grow best in temperatures between 50-70°F (10-21°C). They can tolerate light frosts.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Rocket requires regular watering, especially in warm weather.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Rocket leaves need full sun or partial shade. Provide some shade during hot weather to prevent bolting.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic pest control methods if needed.</li>
