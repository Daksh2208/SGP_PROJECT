            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Mint</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?mint,planting" alt="Mint Planting">
            <p>Mint is a hardy herb that can be grown in various seasons. Here's how to manage its growing periods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Ideal for planting mint as it begins to grow vigorously in the cooler temperatures of early spring. Start seeds indoors or direct sow after the last frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Mint thrives in the summer, provided it gets enough water. It can grow in full sun or partial shade.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Mint can continue to grow in the fall. Harvest leaves before the first frost to ensure they remain fresh.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Mint prefers well-drained, rich soil. Loamy soil is ideal for its growth.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for mint is between 6.0 and 7.0, which is slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with organic compost to improve fertility and drainage.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure to provide steady nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Nutrients:</strong> Mint benefits from additional magnesium. Consider using Epsom salts as a supplement.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> Causes white, powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and ensure good air circulation around plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Rust:</strong> Leads to orange or red pustules on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove infected leaves and apply fungicides as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Results in dark, sunken spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove affected leaves and avoid overhead watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Occurs in poorly drained soils. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve soil drainage and avoid overwatering.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?mint,culture" alt="Cultural Practices for Mint">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Avoid planting mint in the same location year after year. Rotate crops to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and weeds that can harbor diseases. Clean gardening tools regularly to prevent disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Management:</strong> Use raised beds or containers to improve drainage and avoid soil-borne pathogens. Regularly check for soil health and amend as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Practices:</strong> Water the base of plants rather than overhead to minimize leaf wetness and reduce disease risk.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Mint grows best in temperatures between 55-75°F (13-24°C). It can tolerate light frosts but prefers cooler conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mint requires regular watering, especially in dry conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Mint can grow in full sun or partial shade. Provide some shade in extremely hot climates.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like aphids and spider mites. Use organic pest control methods if needed.</li>
