            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Turnip</h2>
            <img src="Turnip(SHalgam).jpg" alt="Turnip Planting">
            <p>Turnips are cool-season crops that thrive in moderate temperatures. Here’s how to manage its growing seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Turnips can be planted in early spring as soon as the soil is workable.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Plant in mid-summer for a fall harvest. Turnips grow best in cooler temperatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Turnips can be harvested in late fall. They can tolerate light frost which can improve their flavor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Heavy clay soils should be amended with compost to improve drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for turnips is between 6.0 and 6.8.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter into the soil before planting to ensure a rich, fertile growing medium.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Turnip</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure to provide essential nutrients and improve soil structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Nutrients:</strong> Turnips benefit from additional potassium and phosphorus to promote root development and overall plant health.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Organic Options:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Enhances soil fertility and provides a steady supply of nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Bone Meal:</strong> Provides phosphorus to support root growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Wood Ash:</strong> Adds potassium and raises soil pH if needed.</li>
            </ul>
