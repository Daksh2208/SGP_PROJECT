            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Sweet Potato</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?sweet-potato" alt="Sweet Potato Planting">
            <p>Sweet potatoes are typically grown in warm climates and have specific seasonal requirements. Here’s how to manage their growing seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plant sweet potatoes in late spring after the risk of frost has passed and the soil has warmed up.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Sweet potatoes require a long, warm growing season. Provide consistent moisture and adequate spacing.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Harvest sweet potatoes before the first frost. Sweet potatoes are generally ready for harvest in late summer to early fall.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Prefers well-drained, sandy loam soil with good organic matter. Avoid heavy, clayey soils.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Optimal soil pH for sweet potatoes is between 6.0 and 6.8.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and structure before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus:</strong> Important for root development. Consider using a phosphorus-rich fertilizer like bone meal.</li>
                <li><strong>Potassium:</strong> Enhances tuber quality and disease resistance. Use potassium-rich fertilizers such as potassium sulfate.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Organic Options:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compost:</strong> Provides a steady supply of nutrients and improves soil health.</li>
                <li><strong>Manure:</strong> Enhances soil fertility and adds valuable organic matter.</li>
                <li><strong>Fish Emulsion:</strong> Supplies essential nutrients, particularly nitrogen, for vigorous growth.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate sweet potatoes with other crops to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases and nutrient depletion.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Ensure adequate spacing between plants to allow for proper tuber development and air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Mulching:</strong> Apply mulch to retain soil moisture, regulate temperature, and suppress weeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Weeding:</strong> Keep the growing area free of weeds that compete for nutrients and water.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Regularly inspect plants for signs of disease and pests to take timely action.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Sweet potatoes grow best in temperatures between 65-85°F (18-29°C). They are sensitive to frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Sweet potatoes require regular watering, especially during dry spells.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Sweet potatoes need full sun to thrive. Ensure they receive at least 6-8 hours of sunlight daily.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as sweet potato weevils and aphids. Use organic pest control methods if necessary.</li>
