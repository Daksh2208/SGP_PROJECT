            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Lemongrass</h2>
            <img src="LemonGrass.jpeg" alt="Lemongrass Planting">
            <p>Lemongrass is a tropical plant that thrives in warm climates. Here’s how to manage its growing seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Ideal for planting lemongrass in temperate regions, as it requires warm temperatures to establish.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Lemongrass grows vigorously during the summer months in tropical and subtropical climates.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> In cooler climates, you can continue growing lemongrass indoors or in a greenhouse to protect it from frost.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="soil">
            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Lemongrass prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Sandy loam is ideal as it provides good drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for lemongrass is between 6.0 and 7.0, which is slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve its fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="fertilizer">
            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Lemongrass</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Compost and well-rotted manure are excellent choices for providing steady nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Nutrients:</strong> Lemongrass may benefit from occasional applications of potassium and magnesium to enhance flavor and growth.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="diseases">
            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Lemongrass</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Causes dark spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove infected leaves and apply fungicides as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Rust:</strong> Leads to orange pustules on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and avoid overhead watering to reduce humidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Caused by overwatering or poorly-drained soil. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper drainage and avoid waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Spider Mites:</strong> Tiny pests that cause yellowing of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticidal soap or neem oil to manage infestations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate crops to prevent disease buildup and avoid planting lemongrass in the same spot each year.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around foliage.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and dispose of plant debris and affected plants to reduce disease sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Water at the base of the plants to keep foliage dry and minimize the risk of fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Select lemongrass varieties that are resistant to common diseases to enhance disease management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Lemongrass thrives in warm temperatures between 70-85°F (21-29°C). It is sensitive to frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Lemongrass requires regular watering, especially during hot periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Ensure the plant receives full sun or partial shade. Lemongrass needs at least 6-8 hours of sunlight daily.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for common pests such as aphids and mites. Use organic pest control methods if necessary.</li>
