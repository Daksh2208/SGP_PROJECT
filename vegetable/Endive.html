            <p>Endive is a cool-season vegetable that thrives in moderate temperatures. The ideal growing seasons are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Start seeds indoors 8-10 weeks before the last frost. Transplant outdoors once the soil is workable.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Direct sow seeds in late summer for a fall harvest. Endive prefers cool temperatures, so it's ideal for autumn planting.</li>
            </ul>
