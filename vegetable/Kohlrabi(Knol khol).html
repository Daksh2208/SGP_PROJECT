            <p>Kohlrabi, also known as Knol Khol, is a cool-season crop. It thrives in moderate temperatures and can be grown in various seasons depending on the region:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Ideal for planting early in spring for a summer harvest. Kohlrabi can withstand light frosts, which can enhance its flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Plant in late summer or early fall for a fall or winter harvest. It can tolerate cooler temperatures and mild frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Winter:</strong> In mild winter climates, kohlrabi can be grown year-round with protective measures to shield from severe cold.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?soil,kohlrabi" alt="Soil for Kohlrabi">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Kohlrabi prefers well-drained, loamy soil enriched with organic matter. Sandy loam or loam with compost works best.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.0. Slightly acidic to neutral soil is preferred.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost or aged manure to provide essential nutrients and improve soil structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure to provide essential nutrients and enhance soil fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Calcium:</strong> Kohlrabi benefits from calcium for better bulb development. Use lime or calcium-rich fertilizers if needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clubroot:</strong> Causes swollen, distorted roots and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and avoid planting in infected soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Causes yellowing and downy growth on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and ensure good air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Black Rot:</strong> Leads to yellowing and wilting of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove affected plants and use crop rotation to prevent reoccurrence.</li>
                <li><strong>Flea Beetles:</strong> Small pests that create holes in leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use row covers or insecticidal soap to manage infestations.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?kohlrabi,cultural-practices" alt="Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate crops to reduce the risk of disease buildup and avoid planting kohlrabi in the same spot year after year.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around foliage.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and dispose of plant debris and affected plants to lower disease sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Water at the base of plants to keep foliage dry and reduce the risk of fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Choose kohlrabi varieties that are resistant to common diseases for better management.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Kohlrabi grows best in cooler temperatures between 55-75°F (13-24°C). It can tolerate light frosts.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Regular watering is essential for bulb development.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 6-8 inches apart to allow for proper bulb development and good air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic pest control methods or insecticidal soap as needed.</li>
