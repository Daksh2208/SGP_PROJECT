            <p>Green peas are cool-season crops that thrive in moderate temperatures. The ideal growing seasons include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Plant peas as soon as the soil can be worked. They can tolerate light frost, making early spring an ideal time.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> In warmer regions, you can also plant peas in late summer to harvest in fall. Ensure they have adequate time to mature before the first frost.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Peas prefer well-drained, loamy soil with good fertility. Sandy loam or clay loam soils are ideal.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The ideal soil pH for green peas is between 6.0 and 7.0. Neutral to slightly acidic soil is best.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and structure before planting.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus:</strong> Phosphorus is essential for root development. Bone meal or a phosphorus-rich fertilizer can be beneficial.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Compost and well-rotted manure provide essential nutrients and improve soil structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> A fungal disease causing white, powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and avoid overhead watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Rust:</strong> Causes orange-brown pustules on leaves and stems. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and remove infected plant debris.</li>
                <li><strong>Pea Weevil:</strong> Insects that feed on developing seeds, causing damage. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use insecticides and practice crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Results in yellowing and curling of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and ensure good air circulation.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Green peas grow best in temperatures between 55-75°F (13-24°C). Protect them from extreme heat and frost.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water deeply and regularly, especially during dry spells.</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Provide support for climbing varieties with trellises or stakes to keep plants upright and improve air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as aphids and pea moths. Use organic pesticides or introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs.</li>
