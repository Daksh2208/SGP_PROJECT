            <img src="Elephant-foot-yam(suran).jpg" alt="Elephant Foot Yam Planting">
            <p>Elephant Foot Yam (Suran) grows best in tropical and subtropical climates. The ideal growing seasons are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monsoon:</strong> Plant during the onset of the monsoon season for optimal growth. This usually starts in early to mid-summer.</li>
                <li><strong>Winter:</strong> The plant can continue growing through winter if the climate remains warm. Harvest before the onset of frost.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="soil">
            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Prefers well-drained, loamy soil with high organic content. Avoid heavy clay soils which can cause waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Ideal pH level is between 5.5 and 7.0. Slightly acidic to neutral soil is best.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure into the soil before planting to enhance fertility and drainage.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="fertilizer">
            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Elephant Foot Yam</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced NPK fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 14-14-14.</li>
                <li><strong>Potassium:</strong> Potassium-rich fertilizers help improve tuber quality. Use potassium sulfate or wood ash.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Compost and well-rotted manure provide essential nutrients and improve soil structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate crops to reduce soil-borne diseases and pests. Avoid planting yam in the same area consecutively.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Clear plant debris and diseased plants regularly to prevent disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Practices:</strong> Use drip irrigation to minimize wetting of foliage and reduce disease risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Choose disease-resistant varieties to improve plant health and reduce vulnerability.</li>
            </ul>
