            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Pumpkins</h2>
            <img src="Pumpkin.jpeg" alt="Pumpkin Planting">
            <p>Pumpkins are warm-season crops that require a long growing period. Here’s how to manage its growing seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Start seeds indoors 2-4 weeks before the last frost date. Transplant seedlings outdoors once temperatures are consistently above 70°F (21°C).</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Pumpkins grow rapidly in summer. Ensure consistent watering and space plants adequately to allow for their large size.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Harvest pumpkins in the fall before the first frost. They should be mature and have a hard rind before harvesting.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="soil">
            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Pumpkins prefer well-drained, loamy soil. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for pumpkins is between 6.0 and 7.0, which is slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility and moisture retention.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="fertilizer">
            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Pumpkins</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 to support overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure to provide steady nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Nutrients:</strong> Pumpkins benefit from additional phosphorus and potassium during the fruiting stage. Consider using a fertilizer with a higher middle number (phosphorus).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="diseases">
            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Pumpkins</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> Causes white, powdery growth on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and provide good air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Leads to yellowing and downy white growth on the underside of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and avoid overhead watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Anthracnose:</strong> Causes sunken, dark lesions on fruit. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove infected fruit and apply appropriate fungicides.</li>
                <li><strong>Bacterial Wilt:</strong> Leads to wilting and death of plants. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plants. Practice crop rotation to prevent recurrence.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultural-practices">
            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate pumpkins with non-cucurbit crops to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases and pests.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Provide ample space between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which helps prevent disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Regularly remove and dispose of plant debris, weeds, and any diseased plants to minimize disease sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Use drip irrigation to avoid water splashing on leaves, which can spread diseases. Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Select pumpkin varieties that are resistant to common diseases in your area.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="care">
            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Pumpkins grow best in temperatures between 70-85°F (21-29°C). They require a long growing season with warm temperatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Pumpkins need regular watering, especially during dry periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Pumpkins need full sun to thrive. Ensure they receive at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like squash bugs and cucumber beetles. Use organic pest control methods if needed.</li>
