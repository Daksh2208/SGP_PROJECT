            <h2>1. Seasons for Growing Fennel Bulbs</h2>
            <img src="Fennel-Bulb.jpeg" alt="Fennel Bulb Planting">
            <p>Fennel bulbs thrive in cooler weather. The ideal growing seasons are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Sow seeds directly outdoors in early spring after the last frost. Fennel grows best when temperatures are between 60-70째F (15-21째C).</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> In mild climates, fennel can also be planted in late summer for a fall harvest. Ensure plants have enough time to mature before the first frost.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Soil Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Fennel prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Avoid heavy clay soils that can cause root rot.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> A neutral to slightly acidic soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0 is ideal.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure into the soil to improve fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="fertilizer">
            <h2>3. Best Fertilizers for Fennel Bulbs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced NPK fertilizer with a ratio of 10-10-10 or 5-10-10. This ensures a balanced supply of nutrients for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Compost and well-rotted manure provide slow-release nutrients and improve soil structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Nitrogen:</strong> Avoid fertilizers high in nitrogen, as they can lead to excessive foliage growth at the expense of bulb development.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="diseases">
            <h2>4. Common Diseases in Fennel Bulbs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> White powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Improve air circulation and apply fungicides if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Yellow or brown patches on leaves with fuzzy gray growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove infected plants and use appropriate fungicides.</li>
                <li><strong>Fusarium Wilt:</strong> Causes yellowing and wilting of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and practice crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Rot:</strong> Caused by overwatering or poor drainage. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Ensure proper soil drainage and avoid overwatering.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="cultural-practices">
            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate crops to reduce the risk of disease buildup in the soil. Avoid planting fennel in the same location each year.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and infected plant parts to prevent the spread of pathogens.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Water at the base of plants to keep the foliage dry and minimize the risk of fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties when possible to improve overall plant health and reduce disease incidence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Growing Conditions and Care</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Fennel grows best in cool to moderate temperatures between 60-70째F (15-21째C). It can tolerate light frosts but prefers not to be exposed to extreme cold.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Drip irrigation is ideal to prevent wetting foliage.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants 8-12 inches apart to allow for bulb development and proper air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests such as aphids and caterpillars. Use organic pest control methods or introduce beneficial insects if necessary.</li>
