            <img src="/vegetable/cucumber_planting.jpg" alt="Cucumber Planting">
            <p>Cucumbers thrive in warm weather. The ideal growing seasons are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Start planting cucumbers once the soil has warmed up and all danger of frost has passed.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Continue growing through the hot months. Cucumbers need ample water and regular harvesting to maintain quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Autumn:</strong> Harvest cucumbers before the first frost. Cool temperatures can affect their quality and yield.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="/vegetable/cucumber_soil.jpg" alt="Soil for Cucumbers">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Prefers well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter. Avoid heavy clay soils that can lead to poor drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Optimal pH is between 6.0 and 7.0.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced NPK fertilizer, such as 10-10-10, for overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Compost and well-rotted manure provide essential nutrients and improve soil structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Potassium-rich Fertilizers:</strong> Enhances fruit quality and plant health. Use fertilizers like potassium sulfate or seaweed extract.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> White powdery substance on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and ensure proper spacing to improve air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Yellowing and wilting of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use resistant varieties and improve airflow around plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Cucumber Mosaic Virus:</strong> Leaves exhibit mottled or distorted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove affected plants and control aphid populations.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Rotate cucumbers with other crops to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Regularly remove fallen leaves and plant debris from the growing area to prevent disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Techniques:</strong> Use drip irrigation to keep leaves dry and minimize the risk of fungal infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Opt for disease-resistant cucumber varieties when available.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="/vegetable/cucumber_care.jpg" alt="Care for Cucumbers">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Optimal temperatures are between 70-85°F (21-29°C). Cucumbers are sensitive to frost and extreme heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep soil consistently moist but well-drained. Avoid overhead watering to prevent diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Space plants about 12-18 inches apart to allow for their sprawling growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Monitor for pests such as cucumber beetles and aphids. Use organic pest control methods like neem oil or insecticidal soap.</li>
