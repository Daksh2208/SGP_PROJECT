            <p>Nettle leaves are hardy and can grow in various conditions. Here’s how to manage their growing seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Ideal time to sow seeds or transplant seedlings as temperatures begin to warm up.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Nettle thrives in summer but requires regular watering to prevent drying out.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Harvest leaves before the first frost to ensure optimal flavor and nutrient content.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Prefers rich, well-drained soil. Loamy soil enriched with organic matter is ideal.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> Nettle prefers slightly acidic to neutral soil, with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Incorporate compost or aged manure into the soil to improve fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 or 14-14-14 for overall growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure to provide essential nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Nutrients:</strong> Nettle benefits from additional nitrogen to support lush growth. Consider using a nitrogen-rich fertilizer.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> Causes white, powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and improve air circulation around plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Rust:</strong> Leads to orange-brown pustules on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Remove affected leaves and apply appropriate fungicides.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaf Spot:</strong> Dark spots with yellow halos on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Avoid overhead watering and use fungicides as necessary.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Cultural Practices for Disease Prevention</h2>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?nettle,culture" alt="Cultural Practices for Nettle">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Crop Rotation:</strong> Avoid planting nettles in the same location year after year. Rotate crops to reduce the risk of soil-borne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Proper Spacing:</strong> Space plants adequately to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves.</li>
                <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove plant debris and weeds that can harbor diseases. Clean gardening tools regularly to prevent disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Management:</strong> Use raised beds or containers to improve drainage and avoid soil-borne pathogens. Regularly check for soil health and amend as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering Practices:</strong> Water the base of plants rather than overhead to minimize leaf wetness and reduce disease risk.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Nettle grows well in temperatures between 50-75°F (10-24°C). It can tolerate cooler temperatures but prefers moderate warmth.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry spells.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Nettle prefers partial shade but can tolerate full sun. Ensure it receives some shade during the hottest part of the day.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like aphids and spider mites. Use organic pest control methods if needed.</li>
