            <p>Mustard greens are a cool-season crop that thrives in moderate temperatures. Here's how to manage their growing seasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spring:</strong> Ideal for planting mustard greens as they grow best in cool weather. Sow seeds outdoors 2-4 weeks before the last frost date.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall:</strong> Mustard greens can be grown in fall for a late harvest. Sow seeds 6-8 weeks before the first expected frost.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Mustard greens prefer well-drained, loamy soil with good organic matter. Sandy loam is ideal for better drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>pH Level:</strong> The optimal soil pH for mustard greens is between 6.0 and 7.0, which is slightly acidic to neutral.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Enrich the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve fertility and structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balanced Fertilizers:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10-10-10 to support healthy growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Options:</strong> Apply compost or well-rotted manure to provide steady nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Nutrients:</strong> Mustard greens may benefit from additional nitrogen during growth. Consider a nitrogen-rich fertilizer if needed.</li>

                <li><strong>Downy Mildew:</strong> Causes yellowing and fuzzy growth on the underside of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use fungicides and improve air circulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Powdery Mildew:</strong> White, powdery spots on leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Apply fungicides and avoid overhead watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Black Rot:</strong> Causes yellowing and wilting of leaves. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties and practice crop rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Clubroot:</strong> Causes swelling of roots and stunted growth. <br><strong>Control:</strong> Avoid planting in soil where clubroot has been present and improve soil drainage.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Mustard greens grow best in temperatures between 50-70°F (10-21°C). They can tolerate light frosts.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Regular watering is important, especially in dry periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Mustard greens need full sun to partial shade. Provide shade in hot climates to prevent bolting.</li>
                <li><strong>Pest Control:</strong> Watch for pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic pest control methods if needed.</li>
